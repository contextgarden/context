PREAMBLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ConTeXt Watch gadget (aka Signal or Squid) is device that can monitor a ConTeXt run in
various ways: segment, quadrant, squid, feedback. It uses serial and/or wifi connections.
The details are discussed in the signals.pdf manual that is part of the regular ConTeXt
distribution. The idea is that a visual feedback is easier (more direct) than staring at a
log. Future versions will provide more detailed feedback.

After prototyping, first with a Raspberry Pico, later with an ESP 32, we settled for the
later. The separate 24 led ring was integrated by Mojca into a circular board. At the 2025
ConTeXt meeting in Poland the first official version was released in a workshop where a
dedicated case (using wood) by Willi was combined with the hardware and flashed by those
present. A prototype 3D printed housing (designed by Vincent) was also presented there.

This project is part of the the LuaMetaTeX / ConText LMTX project. This TeX engine has
serial communication support built in which is used by ConTeXt runner and macro package to
keep track of the current state of the job, oen that can require several passes. The soft-
and hardware designs are part of distribution and has the same license.
