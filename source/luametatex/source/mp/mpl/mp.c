Nota bene

This is not the official reference library but a version meant for \LUAMETATEX\ in combination with
\METAFUN, which is integrated in \CONTEXT. When the original gets improved I will diff the
progression of the original \CWEB\ files and merge improvements. Well, this will no happen, mainly
because the original library can't change (part of the frozen \LUATEX).

I'm pretty sure that the \TEX part of this file doesn't process but I might look into that later.
The comments are kept as they were but there are occasional remarks because we changes some bits
and pieces. The references to properties, variables, constants etc, are mostly kept. I due time
I'll fix it and see if I can render the file, but for now it's okay to just read the comments. I
admit that I check things in Visual Studio anyway, which is why there are now |enum| used.

This split is needed because the original library is the one used for \METAPOST\ the program which
is used by DEK, and I don't want to mess up his workflow. At some point I might emulate \METAPOST\
but I might as well decide to remove the interaction completely from this variant. It al depends on
the outcome of experiments that Alan and I conducted, and as it's done in free time, it will take
while. Don't push us, don't nag, don't complain. The original library is where the support is
concentrated and you can always use that with the \MKIV\ macros.

\startlines
Todo: check typecasts, the halfword and quarterwords are now integers.
Todo: Move more variables into the scope that they're used.
Todo: Remove some (int) cast that are left overs from quarterword.
Todo: Remove unused variables ... postpone more padding till that is done.
Todo: Support color in group objects
\stoplines

Because we don't want macros to clash with fields in record, setters and getters are prefixed by
|mp_|. In order not clash with typedefs and accessors, in some cases |mp_get_| and |mp_set_| are
used (eventually that might be true for all these cases). The |mp_free_| functions are complemented
by |mp_new_| functions. In \MPLIB\ 2 |mp_get_| is used instead so keep that in mind when comparing
the sources. I might also pass |mp| to all macros, just for consistency. To be considered: use the
same record for rgb and cmyk (less code eventually). In order to make extensions a bit easier (and
also because of consistency in enumerations, some _token and _sym and similar specifiers have been
made _command (it was already somewhat inconsistent anyway). When something gets compared to
|cur_cmd| it makes sense to use _command anyway.

Some more comments

At some point Taco Hoekwater brilliantly converted \MP\ into a library. Since then usage and
integration of \METAPOST\ in \CONTEXT\ went even further than before. There were some backends added
for \SVG\ and \PNG, and several number systems could be used. This was quite an effort! The \MP\
program became a wrapper around this library.

The library is also used in \LUATEX\ but there we don't need the backend code at all. Also, having
the traditional \TFM\ generating code (inherited from \MF) makes not much sense because we now live
in an \OPENTYPE\ universum and the hard coded 256 limitations were even for \TYPEONE\ not okay. The
GUST font team use their own tools around \MP\ anyway.

This variant (below) is therefore a stripped down library. Everything related to loading fonts is
gone, and if a \PS\ backend is needed the functionality has to go into its own module (as with \SVG\
and \PNG). This means that code removed here has to go there. One problen then is that the output
primitives have to be brought in too, but in good \CWEB\ practices, that then can be done via change
files (basically extending the data structures and such). However, a more modern variant could be to
just use the library with \LUA, produce \PDF\ and convert that to any format needed. This is what we
do in \CONTEXT. After a decade of usage I like to change a few interface aspects so here this
happens.

So: this variant is {\em not} the official \MP\ library but one meant for usage in \LUAMETATEX\ and
experiments by Alan Braslau and Hans Hagen for more advanced graphics, produced by cooperation
between \LUA\ and \MP. This strategy permits experiments without interference with the full blown
version. Of course we can retrofit interesting extensions into its larger version at some point. It's
all a work of love, done in our own time, so don't push our agenda in this.

Stripping is easier than adding and the things I added were not at the level of the language or
processing but the interface to \LUA\ as well as some details of text processing. Some more of that
might happen. For instance, all file \IO\ now goes via \LUA\ so we assume the callbacks being set.

On my agenda are to delegate printing of messages and errors to the plugin. Also filenames might be
done differently. Messages are already normalized. As a start the psout.w file was stripped and
turned into a mpcommon.w file. This means that the old \PS\ output code is no longer there. Because
that file got small it eventually got merged in here which (1) permits some reshuffling and (2) gives
room for optimizing the interface to \LUA\ (do we need the indirectness?).

Quite some code has been stripped because we assume that \LUA\ can provide these features: file io,
logging, management, error handling, etc. This saves quite a bit of code and also detangles a bit the
mixed program vs. library code. For now the \quote {terminal} approach is kept.

In the process I reformatted the source a bit. Sorry. It is no big deal because it looks like
\METAPOST\ is not evolving, but what does evolve is the code here: scanners and more access, to
mention a few. I've added braces so that comments can go with single statements and there can be no
doubt when \WEB\ macros are used (some braces could go there. More variables will become local (to
branches for instance). Messages are done more directly, etc. etc. One of the reasons for doing that
is that it looks nicer in Visual Studio. There it helps to move some variables to a more local scope.
Of course a side effect is that backporting is now no longer an option. In some cases redundant
braces were removed (when it's clear in the w file) and some else statements have been added where
confusion takes place because that one doesn't return (so compilers can for instance warn about
uninitialized pointers). I made sure that the resulting code is readable in Visual Studio.

Work in progress: prefix with |mp_| so that macros don't clash with fields and we can get rid of |_|
hackery.

Maybe some day: zpair zpath zdraw ztransform: just add an extra z dimension to the existing data
types which makes it compatible too.

Introduction

This is \MP\ by John Hobby, a graphics-language processor based on D. E. Knuth's \MF. Much of the
original Pascal version of this program was copied with permission from MF.web Version 1.9. It
interprets a language very similar to D.E. Knuth's METAFONT, but with changes designed to make it
more suitable for PostScript output.

The main purpose of the following program is to explain the algorithms of \MP\ as clearly as
possible. However, the program has been written so that it can be tuned to run efficiently in a wide
variety of operating environments by making comparatively few changes. Such flexibility is possible
because the documentation that follows is written in the |WEB| language, which is at a higher level
than \CCODE.

A large piece of software like \MP\ has inherent complexity that cannot be reduced below a certain
level of difficulty, although each individual part is fairly simple by itself. The |WEB| language is
intended to make the algorithms as readable as possible, by reflecting the way the individual program
pieces fit together and by providing the cross-references that connect different parts.

Detailed comments about what is going on, and about why things were done in certain ways, have been
liberally sprinkled throughout the program. These comments explain features of the implementation,
but they rarely attempt to explain the \MP\ language itself, since the reader is supposed to be
familiar with {\em The \METAFONT\ book} as well as the manual {\em A User's Manual for \METAPOST},
Computing Science Technical Report 162, AT\AM T Bell Laboratories. The present implementation is a
preliminary version, but the possibilities for new features are limited by the desire to remain as
nearly compatible with \MF\ as possible.

On the other hand, the |WEB| description can be extended without changing the core of the program,
and it has been designed so that such extensions are not extremely difficult to make. The |banner|
string defined here should be changed whenever \MP\ undergoes any modifications, so that it will be
clear which version of \MP\ might be the guilty party when a problem arises.

More comments:

At some point I started adding features to the library (think of stacking) but the more interesting
additions came when Mikael Sundqvist and we side tracked from extending math at the \TEX\ end to
more \METAFUN: intersection lists, arctime lists, path iteration, a few more helpers, some fixes, a
bit more control, access to previously hidden functionality, appended paths, etc. And there is
undoubtly more to come. As with all \LUATEX\ and \LUAMETATEX\ development, most gets explained in
the history documents in the \CONTEXT\ distribution and articles. It was around version 3.14 (end
May 2022).

In March 2024 I decided to merge the documentation into the C files and work from those instead of
the WEB files. The main reason for this move was that we (Mikael Sundqvist and HH) were picking up
on some pending extensions and it's easier to implement these after a little more reshuffling (and
maybe breaking up large functions). There has been extensions without bumping the version number
we now went to 3.15 (normally one can rely on the version number of \LUAMETATEX\ anyway).

The overall \MP\ program begins with the heading just shown, after which comes a bunch of procedure
declarations and function declarations. Finally we will get to the main program, which begins with
the comment |start_here|. If you want to skip down to the main program now, you can look up
|start_here| in the index. But the author suggests that the best way to understand this program is to
follow pretty much the order of \MP's components as they appear in the \CWEB\ description you are now
reading, since the present ordering is intended to combine the advantages of the \quote {bottom up}
and \quote {top down} approaches to the problem of understanding a somewhat complicated system. The
following parameters can be changed at compile time to extend or reduce \MP's capacity.Like the
preceding parameters, the following quantities can be changed to extend or reduce \MP's capacity.

Here are some macros for common programming idioms (incr and decr are now inlined). The order of 
comments is (still) sub-optimal but will be adapted over time (years). We also have macros that 
interface to (previously glonbal) variables. Comments might refer to these without showing the 
definitions as these are in the header file.

The principal computations performed by \MP\ are done entirely in terms of integers less than
$2^{31}$ in magnitude; thus, the arithmetic specified in this program can be carried out in exactly
the same way on a wide variety of computers, including some small ones.

But C does not rigidly define the |/| operation in the case of negative dividends; for example, the
result of |(-2 * n - 1) / 2| is |- ( n + 1)| on some computers and |-n| on others (is this true ?).
There are two principal types of arithmetic: \quotation {translation-preserving,} in which the
identity |(a + q * b) / b = (a / b) + q| is valid; and \quotation {negation-preserving,} in which
|(-a) / b = -(a/b)|. This leads to two \MP s, which can produce different results, although the
differences should be negligible when the language is being used properly. The \TEX\ processor has
been defined carefully so that both varieties of arithmetic will produce identical output, but it
would be too inefficient to constrain \MP\ in a similar way.

To consume a random fraction, the program below will say |next_random|. Now each number system has
its own implementation, true to the original as much as possible.

To produce a uniform random number in the range |0 <= u < x| or |0 >= u > x| or |0 = u = x|, given a
|scaled| value~|x|, we proceed as shown here. Note that the call of |take_fraction| will produce the
values 0 and~|x| with about half the probability that it will produce any other particular values
between 0 and~|x|, because it rounds its answers. This is the original one, that stays as reference:
As said before, now each number system has its own implementation.

Finally, a normal deviate with mean zero and unit standard deviation can readily be obtained with the
ratio method (Algorithm 3.4.1R in {\em The Art of Computer Programming}). This is the original one,
that stays as reference: Now each number system has its own implementation, true to the original as
much as possibile.

The random related code is now in the number system modules!

Before we can go much further, we need to define symbolic names for the internal code numbers that
represent the various commands obeyed by \MP. These codes are somewhat arbitrary, but not completely
so. For example, some codes have been made adjacent so that |case| statements in the program need not
consider cases that are widely spaced, or so that |case| statements can be replaced by |if|
statements. A command can begin an expression if and only if its code lies between
|min_primary_command| and |max_primary_command|, inclusive. The first token of a statement that
doesn't begin with an expression has a command code between |min_command| and
|max_statement_command|, inclusive. Anything less than |min_command| is eliminated during macro
expansions, and anything no more than |max_pre_command| is eliminated when expanding \TEX\ material.
Ranges such as |min_secondary_command..max_secondary_command| are used when parsing expressions, but
the relative ordering within such a range is generally not critical.

The ordering of the highest-numbered commands (|comma<semicolon<end_group<stop|) is crucial for the
parsing and error-recovery methods of this program as is the ordering |if_test<fi_or_else| for the
smallest two commands. The ordering is also important in the ranges |numeric_token..plus_or_minus|
and |left_brace..ampersand|. At any rate, here is the list, for future reference.

Variables and capsules in \MP\ have a variety of \quote {types,} distinguished by the code numbers
defined here. These numbers are also not completely arbitrary. Things that get expanded must have
types |> mp_independent|; a type remaining after expansion is numeric if and only if its code number
is at least |numeric_type|; objects containing numeric parts must have types between |transform_type|
and |pair_type|; all other types must be smaller than |transform_type|; and among the types that are

Values inside \MP\ are stored in non-symbolic nodes that have a |name_type| as well as a |type|. The
possibilities for |name_type| are defined here; they will be explained in more detail later.Primitive
operations that produce values have a secondary identification code in addition to their command
code; it's something like genera and species. For example, |*| has the command code |primary_binary|,
and its secondary identification is |times|. The secondary codes start such that they don't overlap
with the type codes; some type codes (e.g., |mp_string_type|) are used as operators as well as type
identifications. The relative values are not critical, except for |true_code..false_code|,
|or_op..and_op|, and |filled_op..bounded_op|. The restrictions are that
|and_op-false_code=or_op-true_code|, that the ordering of |x_part...blue_part| must match that of
|x_part_operation..mp_blue_part_operation|, and the ordering of |filled_op..bounded_op| must match
that of the code values they test for.

Beware! The operation and type unumerations in some places run in parallel (with an offset. That
makes it possible the handle types with common code using a delta. In some cases the delta is
multiplied by 2 because we have knowns and unknowns. A less sensitive to patches would be to just
duplicate the code (or to use a function call).

There is one global variable so that |id_lookup| does not always have to create a new entry just for

Certain symbols are \quote {frozen} and not redefinable, since they are used in error recovery.Here

Many of \MP's primitives need no |equiv|, since they are identifiable by their |eq_type| alone. These
primitives are loaded into the hash table as follows:Each primitive has a corresponding inverse, so
that it is possible to display the cryptic numeric contents of |eqtb| in symbolic form. Every call of
|primitive| in this program is therefore accompanied by some straightforward code that forms part of
the |print_cmd_mod| routine explained below.We will deal with the other primitives later, at some
point in the program where their |eq_type| and |equiv| values are more meaningful. For example, the
primitives for macro definitions will be loaded when we consider the routines that define macros. It
is easy to find where each particular primitive was treated by looking in the index at the end; for
example, the section where |"def"| entered |eqtb| is listed under \quote {|def| primitive}.

A \MP\ token is either symbolic or numeric or a string, or it denotes a macro parameter or capsule or
an internal; so there are six corresponding ways to encode it internally:

\startitemize[n]

\startitem
    A symbolic token for symbol |p| is represented by the pointer |p|, in the |sym_sym| field of a
    symbolic node in~|mem|. The |type| field is |symbol_node|; and it has a |name_type| to
    differentiate various subtypes of symbolic tokens, which is usually |normal_sym|, but |macro_sym|
    for macro names.
\stopitem

\startitem
    A numeric token whose |scaled| value is~|v| is represented in a non-symbolic node of~|mem|; the
    |type| field is |known|, the |name_type| field is |token|, and the |value| field holds~|v|.
\stopitem

\startitem
    A string token is also represented in a non-symbolic node; the |type| field is |mp_string_type|,
    the |name_type| field is |token|, and the |value| field holds the corresponding |mp_string|.
\stopitem

\startitem
    Capsules have |name_type=capsule|, and their |type| and |value| fields represent arbitrary
    values, with |type| different from |symbol_node| (in ways to be explained later).
\stopitem

\startitem
    Macro parameters appear in |sym_info| fields of symbolic nodes. The |type| field is
    |symbol_node|; the $k$th parameter is represented by |k| in |sym_info|; and |expr_sym| in
    |name_type|, if it is of type |expr|, or |suffix_sym| if it is of type |suffix|, or by |text_sym|
    if it is of type |text|.
\stopitem

\startitem
    The $k$th internal is also represented by |k| in |sym_info|; the |type| field is |symbol_node| as
    for the other symbolic tokens; and |internal_sym| is its |name_type|.
\stopitem

\stopitemize

Actual values of the parameters and internals are kept in a separate stack, as we will see later.
Note that the |type| field of a node has nothing to do with \quote {type} in a printer's sense. It's
curious that the same word is used in such different ways.

The variables of \MP\ programs can be simple, like |x|, or they can combine the structural property
of arrays and records, like |x20a.b|. A \MP\ user assigns a type to a variable like |x20a.b| by
saying, for example, `|boolean| |x[]a.b|'. It's time for us to study how such things are represented
inside of the computer.

Each variable value occupies two consecutive words, either in a non-symbolic node called a value
node, or as a non-symbolic subfield of a larger node. One of those two words is called the |value|
field; it is an integer, containing either a |scaled| numeric value or the representation of some
other type of quantity. (It might also be subdivided into halfwords, in which case it is referred to
by other names instead of |value|.) The other word is broken into subfields called |type|,
|name_type|, and |link|. The |type| field is a quarterword that specifies the variable's type, and
|name_type| is a quarterword from which \MP\ can reconstruct the variable's name (sometimes by using
the |link| field as well). Thus, only 1.25 words are actually devoted to the value itself; the other
three-quarters of a word are overhead, but they aren't wasted because they allow \MP\ to deal with
sparse arrays and to provide meaningful diagnostics.

In this section we shall be concerned only with the structural aspects of variables, not their
values. Later parts of the program will change the |type| and |value| fields, but we shall treat
those fields as black boxes whose contents should not be touched. However, if the |type| field is
|mp_structured|, there is no |value| field, and the second word is broken into two pointer fields
called |attr_head| and |subscr_head|. Those fields point to additional nodes that contain structural
information, as we shall see.

Note TH: DEK and JDH had a nice theoretical split between |value|, |attr| and |subscr| nodes, as
documented above and further below. However, all three types had a bad habit of transmuting into each
other in practice while pointers to them still lived on elsewhere, so using three different C
structures is simply not workable. All three are now represented as a single C structure called
|mp_value_node|.

There is a potential union in this structure in the interest of space saving: |subscript| and
|hashloc| are mutually exclusive. Actually, so are |attr_head| + |subscr_head| on one side and and
|value_| on the other, but because of all the access macros that are used in the code base to get at
values, those cannot be folded into a union (yet); this would have required creating a similar union
in |mp_token_node| where it would only serve to confuse things.

Finally, |parent| only applies in |attr| nodes (the ones that have |hashloc|), but creating an extra
substructure inside the union just for that does not save space and the extra complication in the
structure is not worth the minimal extra code clarification.

When a \MP\ user specifies a path, \MP\ will create a list of knots and control points for the
associated cubic spline curves. If the knots are $z_0$, $z_1$, \dots, $z_n$, there are control points
$z_k^+$ and $z_{k+1}^-$ such that the cubic splines between knots $z_k$ and $z_{k+1}$ are defined by
B麩er's formula 

$$
\eqalign{z(t)&=B(z_k,z_k^+,z_{k+1}^-,z_{k+1};t)\cr
&=(1-t)^3z_k+3(1-t)^2tz_k^++3(1-t)t^2z_{k+1}^-+t^3z_{k+1}\cr}
$$ 

for |0 <= t <= 1|.

There is a 8-word node for each knot $z_k$, containing one word of control information and six words
for the |x| and |y| coordinates of $z_k^-$ and $z_k$ and~$z_k^+$. The control information appears in
the |mp_left_type| and |mp_right_type| fields, which each occupy a quarter of the first word in the
node; they specify properties of the curve as it enters and leaves the knot.

There's also a halfword |link| field, which points to the following knot, and a final supplementary
word (of which only a quarter is used). If the path is a closed contour, knots 0 and |n| are
identical; i.e., the |link| in knot |n-1| points to knot~0. But if the path is not closed, the
|mp_left_type| of knot~0 and the |mp_right_type| of knot~|n| are equal to |endpoint|. In the latter
case the |link| in knot~|n| points to knot~0, and the control points $z_0^-$ and $z_n^+$ are not
used.

Before the B麩er control points have been calculated, the memory space they will ultimately occupy
is taken up by information that can be used to compute them. There are four cases:

\startitemize

\startitem
    If |mp_right_type = mp_open|, the curve should leave the knot in the same direction it entered;
    \MP\ will figure out a suitable direction.
\stopitem

\startitem
    If |mp_right_type = mp_curl|, the curve should leave the knot in a direction depending on the angle
    at which it enters the next knot and on the curl parameter stored in |right_curl|.
\stopitem

\startitem
    If |mp_right_type = mp_given|, the curve should leave the knot in a nonzero direction stored as an
    |angle| in |right_given|.
\stopitem

\startitem
    If |mp_right_type = mp_explicit|, the B麩er control point for leaving this knot has already been
    computed; it is in the |mp_right_x| and |mp_right_y| fields.
\stopitem

\stopitemize

The rules for |mp_left_type| are similar, but they refer to the curve entering the knot, and to
|left| fields instead of |right| fields. Non-|explicit| control points will be chosen based on \quote
{tension} parameters in the |left_tension| and |right_tension| fields. The |atleast| option is
represented by negative tension values.

For example, the \MP\ path specification 

$$
|z0..z1..tension atleast 1..\{curl 2\|z2..z3\{-1,-2\}..tension 3 and 4..p},
$$ 

where \.p is the path |z4..controls z45 and z54..z5|, will
be represented by the six knots

\def\lodash{\hbox to 1.1em{\thinspace\hrulefill\thinspace}}

$$
\vbox{\halign{#\hfil&&\qquad#\hfil\cr 
|mp_left_type| & |left|info          & |x_coord,y_coord| & |mp_right_type| & |right| info\cr 
\noalign{\yskip}
|endpoint|     & \lodash$,\,$\lodash & $x_0,y_0$         & |curl|          & $1.0,1.0$\cr
|open|         & \lodash$,1.0$       & $x_1,y_1$         & |open|          & \lodash$,-1.0$\cr
|curl|         & $2.0,-1.0$          & $x_2,y_2$         & |curl|          & $2.0,1.0$\cr |given|&$d,1.0$&$x_3,y_3$&|given|&$d,3.0$\cr
|open|         & \lodash$,4.0$       & $x_4,y_4$         & |explicit|      & $x_{45},y_{45}$\cr
|explicit|     & $x_{54},y_{54}$     & $x_5,y_5$         & |endpoint|      & \lodash$,\,$\lodash\cr}}
$$ 

Here |d| is the |angle| obtained by calling |n_arg (-unity, -two)|. Of course, this example is more 
complicated than anything a normal user would ever write.

These types must satisfy certain restrictions because of the form of \MP's path syntax: 

\startitemize[r]
\startitem 
    |open| type never appears in the same node together with |endpoint|, |given|, or |curl|. 
 \stopitem 
 \startitem 
    The |mp_right_type| of a node is |explicit| if and only if the |mp_left_type| of the following 
    node is |explicit|. 
 \stopitem 
 \startitem 
   |endpoint| types occur only at the ends, as mentioned above.
\stopitem
\stopitemize

Knots can be user-supplied, or they can be created by program code, like the |split_cubic| function,
or |copy_path|. The distinction is needed for the cleanup routine that runs after |split_cubic|,
because it should only delete knots it has previously inserted, and never anything that was
user-supplied. In order to be able to differentiate one knot from another, we will set |originator(p)
:= mp_metapost_user| when it appeared in the actual metapost program, and |originator(p) :=
mp_program_code| in all other cases.

Now we come to \MP's internal scheme for representing pictures: edge structures. The representation
is very different from \MF's edge structures because \MP\ pictures contain \ps\ graphics objects
instead of pixel images. However, the basic idea is somewhat similar in that shapes are represented
via their boundaries.

The main purpose of edge structures is to keep track of graphical objects until it is time to
translate them into \ps. Since \MP\ does not need to know anything about an edge structure other than
how to translate it into \ps\ and how to find its bounding box, edge structures can be just linked
lists of graphical objects. \MP\ has no easy way to determine whether two such objects overlap, but
it suffices to draw the first one first and let the second one overwrite it if necessary.Let's
consider the types of graphical objects one at a time. First of all, a filled contour is represented
by a eight-word node. The first word contains |type| and |link| fields, and the next six words
contain a pointer to a cyclic path and the value to use for \ps' |currentrgbcolor| parameter. If a
pen is used for filling |pen_p|, |linejoin| and |miterlimit| give the relevant information. We can
actually be more sparse: |color_model|, |line_join| and |pen_type| can be chars: a todo.

We don't save that much by distinguishing between a stroke and a fill object and we can save some
code when we make then the same. Todo: use char for some.

All the essential information in an edge structure is encoded as a linked list of graphical objects
as we have just seen, but it is helpful to add some redundant information. A single edge structure
might be used as a dash pattern many times, and it would be nice to avoid scanning the same structure
repeatedly. Thus, an edge structure known to be a suitable dash pattern has a header that gives a
list of dashes in a sorted order designed for rapid translation into \POSTSCRIPT.

Each dash is represented by a three-word node containing the initial and final $x$~coordinates as
well as the usual |link| field. The |link| fields points to the dash node with the next higher
$x$-coordinates and the final link points to a special location called |null_dash|. (There should be
no overlap between dashes). Since the $y$~coordinate of the dash pattern is needed to determine the
period of repetition, this needs to be stored in the edge header along with a pointer to the list of
dash nodes.

It is also convenient for an edge header to contain the bounding box information needed by the
|llcorner| and |urcorner| operators so that this does not have to be recomputed unnecessarily. This
is done by adding fields for the $x$ and $y$ extremes as well as a pointer that indicates how far the
bounding box computation has gotten. Thus if the user asks for the bounding box and then adds some
more text to the picture before asking for more bounding box information, the second computation need
only look at the additional text. When the bounding box has not been computed, the |bblast| pointer
points to a dummy link at the head of the graphical object list while the |minx_val| and |miny_val|
fields contain |EL_GORDO| and the |maxx_val| and |maxy_val| fields contain |-EL_GORDO|.

Since the bounding box of pictures containing objects of type |mp_start_bounds_node| depends on the
value of |truecorners|, the bounding box data might not be valid for all values of this parameter.
Hence, the |bbtype| field is needed to keep track of this.

This case involves a recursive call that advances |mp_bblast(h)| to the node of type

Finding an envelope. When \MP\ has a path and a polygonal pen, it needs to express the desired shape
in terms of things \ps\ can understand. The present task is to compute a new path that describes the
region to be filled. It is convenient to define this as a two step process where the first step is
determining what offset to use for each segment of the path.

Given a pointer |c| to a cyclic path, and a pointer~|h| to the first knot of a pen polygon, the
|offset_prep| routine changes the path into cubics that are associated with particular pen offsets.
Thus if the cubic between |p| and |q| is associated with the |k|th offset and the cubic between |q|
and~|r| has offset |l| then |mp_info(q) = zero_off + l - k|. (The constant |zero_off| is added to
because |l - k| could be negative.)

After overwriting the type information with offset differences, we no longer have a true path so we
refer to the knot list returned by |offset_prep| as an \quote {envelope spec.} Since an envelope 
spec only determines relative changes in pen offsets, |offset_prep| sets a global variable 
|spec_offset| to the relative change from |h| to the first offset.

Since we're interested in the tangent directions, we work with the derivative

$$
{1\over3}B'(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3;t)= B(x_1-x_0,x_2-x_1,x_3-x_2;t)
$$ 

instead of $B(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3;t)$ itself. The derived coefficients are also scale-d up in order to 
achieve better accuracy.

The given path may turn abruptly at a knot, and it might pass the critical tangent direction at such
a time. Therefore we remember the direction |phi| in which the previous rotated cubic was traveling.
(The value of |phi| will be undefined on the first cubic, i.e., when |n=0|.) The intersection of two
cubics can be found by an interesting variant of the general bisection scheme described in the
introduction to |crossing_point|.\ Given $w(t) = B(w_0,w_1,w_2,w_3;t)$ and $z(t) = B(z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3;t)$,
we wish to find a pair of times $(t_1,t_2)$ such that $w(t_1) = z(t_2)$, if an intersection exists.
First we find the smallest rectangle that encloses the points $\{w_0,w_1,w_2,w_3\}$ and check that it
overlaps the smallest rectangle that encloses $\{z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3\}$; if not, the cubics certainly
don't intersect. But if the rectangles do overlap, we bisect the intervals, getting new cubics $w'$
and~$w''$, $z'$~and~$z''$; the intersection routine first tries for an intersection between $w'$
and~$z'$, then (if unsuccessful) between $w'$ and~$z''$, then (if still unsuccessful) between $w''$
and~$z'$, finally (if thrice unsuccessful) between $w''$ and~$z''$. After $l$~successful levels of
bisection we will have determined the intersection times $t_1$ and~$t_2$ to $l$~bits of accuracy.

\def\submin{_{\rm min}} \def\submax{_{\rm max}}

As before, it is better to work with the numbers $W_k = 2^l(w_k-w_{k-1})$ and $Z_k = 2^l(z_k-z_{k-1})$
rather than the coefficients $w_k$ and $z_k$ themselves. We also need one other quantity,
$\Delta = 2^l(w_0-z_0)$, to determine when the enclosing rectangles overlap. Here's why: The
$x$~coordinates of~$w(t)$ are between $u\submin$ and $u\submax$, and the $x$ coordinates of $z(t)$
are between $x\submin$ and $x\submax$, if we write $w_k=(u_k,v_k)$ and $z_k = (x_k,y_k)$ and $u\submin
= \min(u_0,u_1,u_2,u_3)$, etc. These intervals of $x$ coordinates overlap if and only if $u\submin\L
x\submax$ and $x\submin\L u\submax$. Letting

$$
U\submin=\min(0,U_1,U_1+U_2,U_1+U_2+U_3),\;
U\submax=\max(0,U_1,U_1+U_2,U_1+U_2+U_3),
$$

we have $2^lu\submin = 2^lu_0+U\submin$, etc.; the condition for overlap reduces to

$$
X\submin-U\submax\L 2^l(u_0-x_0)\L X\submax-U\submin.
$$

Thus we want to maintain the quantity $2^l(u_0-x_0)$; similarly, the quantity $2^l(v_0-y_0)$ accounts
for the $y$ coordinates. The coordinates of $\Delta = 2^l(w_0-z_0)$ must stay bounded as $l$ increases,
because of the overlap condition; i.e., we know that $X\submin$, $X\submax$, and their relatives are
bounded, hence $X\submax- U\submin$ and $X\submin-U\submax$ are bounded.

Incidentally, if the given cubics intersect more than once, the process just sketched will not
necessarily find the lexicographically smallest pair $(t_1,t_2)$. The solution actually obtained will
be smallest in \quote {shuffled order}; i.e., if $t_1 = (.a_1a_2\ldots a_{16})_2$ and
$t_2 = (.b_1b_2\ldots b_{16})_2$, then we will minimize $a_1b_1a_2b_2\ldots a_{16}b_{16}$, not
$a_1a_2\ldots a_{16}b_1b_2\ldots b_{16}$. Shuffled order agrees with lexicographic order if all pairs
of solutions $(t_1,t_2)$ and $(t_1',t_2')$ have the property that $t_1 < t_1'$ iff $t_2 < t_2'$; but in
general, lexicographic order can be quite different, and the bisection algorithm would be
substantially less efficient if it were constrained by lexicographic order.

For example, suppose that an overlap has been found for $l = 3$ and $(t_1,t_2) = (.101,.011)$ in binary,
but that no overlap is produced by either of the alternatives $(.1010,.0110)$, $(.1010,.0111)$ at
level~4. Then there is probably an intersection in one of the subintervals $(.1011,.011x)$; but
lexicographic order would require us to explore $(.1010,.1xxx)$ and $(.1011,.00xx)$ and
$(.1011,.010x)$ first. We wouldn't want to store all of the subdivision data for the second path, so
the subdivisions would have to be regenerated many times. Such inefficiencies would be associated
with every `1' in the binary representation of $t_1$.

The subdivision process introduces rounding errors, hence we need to make a more liberal test for
overlap. It is not hard to show that the computed values of $U_i$ differ from the truth by at
most~$l$, on level~$l$, hence $U\submin$ and $U\submax$ will be at most $3l$ in error. If $\beta$ is
an upper bound on the absolute error in the computed components of $\Delta = (|delx|,|dely|)$ on
level~$l$, we will replace the test `$X\submin-U\submax\L|delx|$' by the more liberal test
`$X\submin-U\submax\L|delx| + |tol|$', where $|tol| = 6l+\beta$.

More accuracy is obtained if we try the algorithm first with |tol=0|; the more liberal tolerance is
used only if an exact approach fails. It is convenient to do this double-take by letting `3' in the
preceding paragraph be a parameter, which is first 0, then 3.We shall use an explicit stack to
implement the recursive bisection method described above. The |bisect_stack| array will contain
numerous 5-word packets like $(U_1,U_2,U_3,U\submin,U\submax)$, as well as 20-word packets comprising
the 5-word packets for $U$, $V$, $X$, and~$Y$.

The following macros define the allocation of stack positions to the quantities needed for
bisection-intersection.

But how are dependency lists represented? It's simple: The linear combination
$\alpha_1v_1 + \cdots + \alpha_kv_k + \beta$ appears in |k+1| value nodes. If |q = mp_get_dep_list(p)| 
points to this list, and if |k > 0|, then |mp_get_dep_value(q) = ?| (which is a |fraction|);
|mp_get_dep_info(q)| points to the location of $\alpha_1$; and |mp_link(p)| points to the dependency
list $\alpha_2v_2 + \cdots + \alpha_kv_k + \beta$. On the other hand if |k = 0|, then 
|mp_get_dep_value(q) = ?| (which is |scaled|) and |mp_get_dep_info(q) = NULL|. The independent 
variables $v_1$, \dots,~$v_k$ have been sorted so that they appear in decreasing order of their 
|value| fields (i.e., of their serial numbers). \ (It is convenient to use decreasing order, since 
|value(NULL) = 0|. If the independent variables were not sorted by serial number but by some other 
criterion, such as their location in |mem|, the equation-solving mechanism would be too 
system-dependent, because the ordering can affect the computed results.)

The |link| field in the node that contains the constant term $\beta$ is called the {\sl final link}
of the dependency list. \MP\ maintains a doubly-linked master list of all dependency lists, in terms
of a permanently allocated node in |mem| called |dep_head|. If there are no dependencies, we have
|mp_link(dep_head) = dep_head| and |mp_get_prev_dep(dep_head) = dep_head|; otherwise 
|mp_link(dep_head)| points to the first dependent variable, say~|p|, and |mp_get_prev_dep(p)=dep_head|. 
We have |type(p) = mp_dependent|, and |mp_get_dep_list(p)| points to its dependency list. If the final
link of that dependency list occurs in location~|q|, then |mp_link(q)| points to the next dependent 
variable (say |r|); and we have |mp_get_prev_dep(r) = q|, etc.

Dependency nodes sometimes mutate into value nodes and vice versa, so their structures have to match.

One of the main operations needed on dependency lists is to add a multiple of one list to the other;
we call this |p_plus_fq|, where |p| and~|q| point to dependency lists and |f| is a fraction.

If the coefficient of any independent variable becomes |coef_bound| or more, in absolute value, this
procedure changes the type of that variable to |independent_needing_fix|, and sets the global
variable |fix_needed| to |true|. The value of $|coef_bound|=\mu$ is chosen so that $\mu^2 + \mu<8$;
this means that the numbers we deal with won't get too large. (Instead of the \quote {optimum}
$\mu=(\sqrt{33} - 1) / 2\approx 2.3723$, the safer value 7/3 is taken as the threshold.)

The changes mentioned in the preceding paragraph are actually done only if the global variable
|watch_coefs| is |true|. But it usually is; in fact, it is |false| only when \MP\ is making a
dependency list that will soon be equated to zero. Several procedures that act on dependency lists,
including |p_plus_fq|, set the global variable |dep_final| to the final (constant term) node of the
dependency list that they produce.

fifth parameter~|tt| should be |mp_proto_dependent| if |q| is a proto-dependency list. List |q| is
unchanged by the operation; but list |p| is totally destroyed. The final link of the dependency list
or proto-dependency list returned by |p_plus_fq| is the same as the original final link of~|p|.
Indeed, the constant term of the result will be located in the same |mem| location as the original
constant term of~|p|.

Coefficients of the result are assumed to be zero if they are less than a certain threshold. This
compensates for inevitable rounding errors, and tends to make more variables |known|. The threshold
is approximately $10^{-5}$ in the case of normal dependency lists, $10^{-4}$ for proto-dependencies.

And here's a more interesting way to start a dependency list from scratch: The parameter to
|single_dependency| is the location of an independent variable~|x|, and the result is the simple
dependency list |x+0|.

In the unlikely event that the given independent variable has been doubled so often that we can't
refer to it with a nonzero coefficient, |single_dependency| returns the simple list `0'. This case
can be recognized by testing that the returned list pointer is equal to |dep_final|.

/*tex

The state of \MP's input mechanism appears in the input stack, whose entries are records with five
fields, called |index|, |start|, |loc|, |limit|, and |name|. The top element of this stack is
maintained in a global variable for which no subscripting needs to be done; the other elements of the
stack appear in an array. Hence the stack is declared thus:

We've already defined the special variable |loc==cur_input.loc_field| in our discussion of basic
input-output routines. The other components of |cur_input| are defined in the same way:

*/

# define  iindex mp->cur_input.index_field
# define  start  mp->cur_input.start_field
# define  limit  mp->cur_input.limit_field
# define  name   mp->cur_input.name_field

/*tex

Let's look more closely now at the five control variables (|index|, |start|, |loc|, |limit|, |name|),
assuming that \MP\ is reading a line of characters that have been input from some file or from the
user's terminal. There is an array called |buffer| that acts as a stack of all lines of characters
that are currently being read from files, including all lines on subsidiary levels of the input stack
that are not yet completed. \MP\ will return to the other lines when it is finished with the present
input file. (Incidentally, on a machine with byte-oriented addressing, it would be appropriate to
combine |buffer| with the |str_pool| array, letting the buffer entries grow downward from the top of
the string pool and checking that these two tables don't bump into each other.)

The line we are currently working on begins in position |start| of the buffer; the next character we
are about to read is |buffer[loc]|; and |limit| is the location of the last character present. We
always have |loc<=limit|. For convenience, |buffer[limit]| has been set to |"%"|, so that the end of
a line is easily sensed.

The |name| variable is a string number that designates the name of the current file, if we are
reading an ordinary text file. Special codes |is_term..max_spec_src| indicate other sources of input
text.

*/

# define  is_term    (mp_string) 0
# define  is_read    (mp_string) 1
# define  is_scantok (mp_string) 2

# define  max_spec_src is_scantok

/*tex

Additional information about the current line is available via the |index| variable, which counts how
many lines of characters are present in the buffer below the current level. We have |index=0| when
reading from the terminal and prompting the user for each line; then if the user types, e.g., |input
figs|, we will have |index=1| while reading the file |figs.mp|. However, it does not follow that
|index| is the same as the input stack pointer, since many of the levels on the input stack may come
from token lists.

The global variable |in_open| is equal to the highest |index| value excluding token-list input
levels. Thus, the number of partially read lines in the buffer is |in_open+1| and we have
|in_open>=index| when we are not reading a token list. If we are not currently reading from the
terminal, we are reading from the file variable |input_file[index]|. We use the notation
|terminal_input| as a convenient abbreviation for |name=is_term|, and |cur_file| as an abbreviation
for |input_file[index]|.

When \MP\ is not reading from the terminal, the global variable |line| contains the line number in
the current file, for use in error messages. More precisely, |line| is a macro for
|line_stack[index]| and the |line_stack| array gives the line number for each file in the
|input_file| array.

If more information about the input state is needed, it can be included in small arrays like those
shown here. For example, the current page or segment number in the input file might be put into a
variable |page|, that is really a macro for the current entry in \quote {|page_stack:array [0 .. 
max_in_open] of integer|} by analogy with |line_stack|.

*/

# define  cur_file       mp->input_file[iindex]
# define  line           mp->line_stack[iindex]

/*tex

This has to be more than |file_bottom|, so:

However, all this discussion about input state really applies only to the case that we are inputting
from a file. There is another important case, namely when we are currently getting input from a token
list. In this case |iindex > max_in_open|, and the conventions about the other state variables are
different:

\startitemize

\startitem
    |nloc| is a pointer to the current node in the token list, i.e., the node that will be read 
    next. If |nloc = NULL|, the token list has been fully read.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |start| points to the first node of the token list; this node may or may not contain a 
    reference count, depending on the type of token list involved.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |token_type|, which takes the place of |iindex| in the discussion above, is a code number that
    explains what kind of token list is being scanned.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |name| points to the |eqtb| address of the control sequence being expanded, if the current token
    list is a macro not defined by |vardef|. Macros defined by |vardef| have |name = NULL|; their 
    name can be deduced by looking at their first two parameters.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |param_start|, which takes the place of |limit|, tells where the parameters of the current macro
    or loop text begin in the |param_stack|.
\stopitem

\stopitemize

The |token_type| can take several values, depending on where the current token list came from:

\startitemize

\startitem
    |forever_text|, if the token list being scanned is the body of a |forever| loop;
\stopitem

\startitem
    |loop_text|, if the token list being scanned is the body of a |for| or |forsuffixes| loop;
\stopitem

\startitem
    |parameter|, if a |text| or |suffix| parameter is being scanned;
\stopitem

\startitem
    |backed_up|, if the token list being scanned has been inserted as `to be read again'.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |inserted|, if the token list being scanned has been inserted as part of error recovery;
\stopitem

\startitem
    |macro|, if the expansion of a user-defined symbolic token is being scanned.
\stopitem

\stopitemize

The token list begins with a reference count if and only if |token_type= macro|.

In a construction like \quote {|if| |if| |true|: $0=1$: |foo| |else|: |bar| |fi|{'}, the first 
|else| that we come to after learning that the |if| is false is not the |else| we're looking for. 
Hence the following curious logic is needed.

The processing of conditionals is complete except for the following code, which is actually part of
|get_x_next|. It comes into play when |elseif|, |else|, or |fi| is scanned.

To bring our treatment of |get_x_next| to a close, we need to consider what \MP\ does when it sees
|for|, |forsuffixes|, and |forever|. There's a global variable |loop_ptr| that keeps track of the
|for| loops that are currently active. If |loop_ptr=NULL|, no loops are in progress; otherwise
|loop_ptr.info| points to the iterative text of the current (innermost) loop, and |loop_ptr.link|
points to the data for any other loops that enclose the current one.

A loop-control node also has two other fields, called |type| and |list|, whose contents depend on 
the type of loop:

\startitemize

\startitem
|loop_ptr.type = NULL| means that the link of |loop_ptr.list| points to a list of symbolic nodes 
whose |info| fields point to the remaining argument values of a suffix list and expression list. In 
this case, an extra field |loop_ptr.start_list| is needed to make sure that |resume_operation| skips
ahead.
\stopitem

\startitem
|loop_ptr.type = MP_VOID| means that the current loop is |forever|.
\stopitem

\startitem
|loop_ptr.type = MP_PROGRESSION_FLAG| means that |loop_ptr.value|, |loop_ptr.step_size|, and
|loop_ptr.final_value| contain the data for an arithmetic progression.
\stopitem

\startitem
|loop_ptr.type = p > MP_PROGRESSION_FLAG| means that |p| points to an edge header and |loop_ptr.list|
points into the graphical object list for that edge header.
\stopitem

\stopitemize

Introduction to the parsing routines

We come now to the central nervous system that sparks many of \MP's activities. By evaluating
expressions, from their primary constituents to ever larger subexpressions, \MP\ builds the
structures that ultimately define complete pictures or fonts of type. Four mutually recursive
subroutines are involved in this process: We call them |scan_primary|, |scan_secondary|,
|scan_tertiary|, and |scan_expression|.

Each of them is parameterless and begins with the first token to be scanned already represented in
|cur_cmd|, |cur_mod|, and |cur_sym|. After execution, the value of the primary or secondary or
tertiary or expression that was found will appear in the global variables |cur_type| and |cur_exp|.
The token following the expression will be represented in |cur_cmd|, |cur_mod|, and |cur_sym|.

Technically speaking, the parsing algorithms are \quote {LL(1),} more or less; backup mechanisms 
have been added in order to provide reasonable error recovery.

The next procedure, |scan_tertiary|, is pretty much the same deal.Finally we reach the deepest level
in our quartet of parsing routines.

This one is much like the others; but it has an extra complication from paths, which materialize
here.The reader should review the data structure conventions for paths before hoping to understand
the next part of this code.

/* MOVE

In the following procedure, |cur_exp| points to a capsule, which points to a big node. We want to
delete all but one part of the big node.

This one is stripped because it only handles |ASCII|. Watch out, the |ASCII| operator only looks at
the first character and then just interprets the character as byte. One can implement a \UTF\
interpreter in \LUA.This computes the length of the current path or picture. The only benefit from
not using the numbers but a temporary |int| instead is .5K smaller which is due to less interfacing.
But it also demonstrates that on the one hand the number system indirectness adds quite some bytes
but on the other hand todays compilers do a pretty good job at optimizing (for performance). Which 
of course doesn't mean that scaled outperforms double manyfold while decimal is always way slower.

The function |an_angle| returns the value of the |angle| primitive, or $0$ if the argument is
|origin|.The actual turning number is (for the moment) computed in a C function that receives eight
integers corresponding to the four controlling points, and returns a single angle. Besides those, 
we have to account for discrete moves at the actual points.

The first argument to |try_eq| is the location of a value node in a capsule that will soon be

size rapidly until finding the range, then to go sequentially until the exact borderline has been
discovered. Heights, depths, and italic corrections are different from widths not only because their
list length is more severely restricted, but also because zero values do not need to be put into the
list.

Shipping pictures out.

The |ship_out| procedure, to be described below, is given a pointer to an edge structure.
Originally the output was targeted at \POSTSCRIPT\ but the library has no backend. It privides the
result as a structure that reflects the original \POSTSCRIPT\ backend. We could use more direct
methods but for now we follow the route with an intermediate. Actually, it's that intermediate that
is kind of the standard output \API. We no longer report the shipped outfigure because the  backend 
can do that, but we keep the number.

The character set

We assume proper ASCII codes to be used and likely UTF-8 so we dropped the two way mapping from input
to internal and from internal to to output (actually that mapping was not that robust because some
strings bypassed the conversions).

Input and output

The bane of portability is the fact that different operating systems treat input and output quite
differently, perhaps because computer scientists have not given sufficient attention to this problem.
People have felt somehow that input and output are not part of \quote {real} programming. Well, it is
true that some kinds of programming are more fun than others. With existing input/output conventions
being so diverse and so messy, the only sources of joy in such parts of the code are the rare
occasions when one can find a way to make the program a little less bad than it might have been. We
have two choices, either to attack I/O now and get it over with, or to postpone I/O until near the
end. Neither prospect is very attractive, so let's get it over with.

The basic operations we need to do are 

\startitemize[n]
\startitem 
    inputting and outputting of text, to or from a file or the user's terminal; 
\stopitem 
\startitem 
    inputting and outputting of eight-bit bytes, to or from a file; 
\stopitem 
\startitem 
    instructing the operating system to initiate \quote {open} or to terminate \quote {close} input
    or output from a specified file; 
\stopitem 
\startitem 
    testing whether the end of an input file has been reached; 
\stopitem 
\startitem 
    display of bits on the user's screen. 
\stopitem 
\stopitmize
    
The bit-display operation will be discussed in a later section; we shall deal here only with more 
traditional kinds of I/O.

Finding files happens in a slightly roundabout fashion: the \MP\ instance object contains a field
that holds a function pointer that finds a file, and returns its name, or NULL. For this, it 
receives three parameters: the non-qualified name |fname|, the intended |fopen| operation type 
|fmode|, and the type of the file |ftype|.

The file types that are passed on in |ftype| can be used to differentiate file searches if a library
like kpathsea is used, the fopen mode is passed along for the same reason.

The default function for finding files is |mp_find_file|. It is pretty stupid: it will only find
files in the current directory.

(Almost) all file names pass through |name_of_file|. If this parameter is true, the terminal and log
will report the found file names for input files instead of the requested ones. It is off by default
because it creates an extra filename lookup.

\MP's file-opening procedures return |false| if no file identified by |name_of_file| could be opened.

The |do_open_file| function takes care of the |print_found_names| parameter. The file helpers are
mandate callbacks. Not setting them triggers an error.

For now we keep the two step find and open approach because we get back the full (found) name but all
logic is at the \LUA\ end. Maybe some day we need the original name.

Watch out: at this moment we have |mp_find_file| as well as |open_file| and both need to be set.As

/*tex MOVE

Symbolic token names and diagnostic messages are variable-length strings of eight-bit characters.
Many strings \MP\ uses are simply literals in the compiled source, like the error messages and the
names of the internal parameters. Other strings are used or defined from the \MP\ input language, and
these have to be interned.

\MP\ uses strings more extensively than \MF\ does, but the necessary operations can still be handled
with a fairly simple data structure. The avl tree |strings| contains all of the known string
structures.

Each structure contains an |unsigned char| pointer containing the eight-bit data, a |size_t| that
holds the length of that data, and an |int| that indicates how often this string is referenced (this
will be explained below). Such strings are referred to by structure pointers called |mp_string|.

Besides the avl tree, there is a set of three variables called |cur_string|, |cur_length| and
|cur_string_size| that are used for strings while they are being built.The string handling functions
are in |mpstrings.w|, but strings need a bunch of globals and those are defined here in the main
file.

Messages that are sent to a user's terminal and to the transcript-log file are produced by several
|print| procedures. These procedures will direct their output to a variety of places, based on the
setting of the global variable |selector|, which has the following possible values:

\startitemize

\startitem
    |term_and_log|, the normal setting, prints on the terminal and on the transcript file.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |log_only|, prints only on the transcript file.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |term_only|, prints only on the terminal.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |no_print|, doesn't print at all. This is used only in rare cases before the transcript file is
    open.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |pseudo|, puts output into a cyclic buffer that is used by the |show_context| routine; when we
    get to that routine we shall discuss the reasoning behind this curious mode.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |new_string|, appends the output to the current string in the string pool.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |>= first_file| prints on one of the files used for the |write| command.
\stopitem

\stopitemize

The symbolic names |term_and_log|, etc., have been assigned numeric codes that satisfy the convenient
relations |no_print + 1 = term_only|, |no_print + 2 = log_only|, |term_only + 2 = log_only + 1 =
term_and_log|. These relations are not used when |selector| could be |pseudo|, or |new_string|. We
need not check for unprintable characters when |selector < pseudo|. We no longer use that magic and
just test the constants.

Two additional global variables, |term_offset| and |file_offset| record if characters have been
printed since they were most recently cleared. We use |term_offset|, and |file_offset|, on the other
hand, keep track of how many characters have appeared so far on the current line that has been output
to the terminal, the transcript file, or piped into \LUA.

Macro abbreviations for output to the terminal and to the log file are defined here for convenience.
Some systems need special conventions for terminal output, and it is possible to adhere to those
conventions by changing |wterm|, |wterm_ln|, and |wterm_cr| here.To end a line of text output, we
call |print_ln|. Cases |0..max_write_files| use an array |wr_file| that will be declared later.

The names of the print functions are more or less in sync with the ones used in the \LUAMETATEX\
source code.

The global variable |interaction| has four settings, representing increasing amounts of user
interaction:

Set it here so it can be overwritten by the commandline\MP\ is careful not to call |error| when the
print |selector| setting might be unusual. The only possible values of |selector| at the time of
error messages are

\startitemize

\startitem
    |no_print| (when |interaction=mp_batch_mode| and |log_file| not yet open);
\stopitem
\startitem
    |term_only| (when |interaction>mp_batch_mode| and |log_file| not yet open);
\stopitem
\startitem
    |log_only| (when |interaction=mp_batch_mode| and |log_file| is open);
\stopitem
\startitem
    |term_and_log| (when |interaction>mp_batch_mode| and |log_file| is open).
\stopitem

\stopitemize

The global variable |history| records the worst level of error that has been detected. It has four
possible values: |spotless|, |warning_issued|, |error_message_issued|, and |fatal_error_stop|.

Another global variable, |error_count|, is increased by one when an |error| occurs without an
interactive dialog, and it is reset to zero at the end of every statement. If |error_count| reaches
100, \MP\ decides that there is no point in continuing further.

The value of |history| is initially |fatal_error_stop|, but it will be changed to |spotless| if \MP\
survives the initialization process.

Since errors can be detected almost anywhere in \MP, we want to declare the error procedures near the
beginning of the program. But the error procedures in turn use some other procedures, which need to
be declared |forward| before we get to |error| itself.

It is possible for |error| to be called recursively if some error arises when |get_next| is being
used to delete a token, and/or if some fatal error occurs while \MP\ is trying to fix a non-fatal
one. But such recursion is never more than two levels deep.

The |jump_out| procedure just cuts across all active procedure levels and goes to |end_of_MP|. This
is the only nonlocal |goto| statement in the whole program. It is used when there is no recovery from
a particular error.

The program uses a |jump_buf| to handle this, this is initialized at three spots: the start of
|mp_new|, the start of |mp_initialize|, and the start of |mp_run|. Those are the only library entry
points.If the array of internals is still |NULL| when |jump_out| is called, a crash occured during
initialization, and it is not safe to run the normal cleanup routine.

Individual lines of help are recorded in the array |help_line|, which contains entries in positions
|0 .. (help_ptr - 1)|. They should be printed in reverse order, i.e., with |help_line [0]| appearing
last.

And now let's complete our collection of numeric utility routines by considering random number
generation. \MP\ generates pseudo-random numbers with the additive scheme recommended in Section 3.6
of {\em The Art of Computer Programming}; however, the results are random fractions between 0 and
|fraction_one-1|, inclusive.

There's an auxiliary array |randoms| that contains 55 pseudo-random fractions. Using the recurrence
$x_n = (x_{n - 55} - x_{n - 31}) \bmod 2^{28}$, we generate batches of 55 new $x_n$'s at a time by
calling |new_randoms|. The global variable |j_random| tells which element has most recently been
consumed. The global variable |random_seed| was introduced in version 0.9, for the sole reason of
stressing the fact that the initial value of the random seed is system-dependant. The initialization
code below will initialize this variable to |(internal [mp_time] div unity) + internal [mp_day]|, but
this is not good enough on modern fast machines that are capable of running multiple \METAPOST\

The symbolic names for internal quantities are put into \MP's hash table by using a routine called
|primitive|, which will be defined later. Let us enter them now, so that we don't have to list all
those names again anywhere else.Colors can be specified in four color models. In the special case of
|no_model|, MetaPost does not output any color operator to the postscript output.

Note: these values are passed directly on to |with_option|. This only works because the other
possible values passed to |with_option| are 8 and 10 respectively (from |with_pen| and
|with_picture|).

There is a first state, that is only used for |gs_colormodel|. It flags the fact that there has not
been any kind of color specification by the user so far in the game.

Well, we do have to list the names one more time, for use in symbolic printouts.The following
procedure, which is called just before \MP\ initializes its input and output, establishes the initial
values of the date and time.

Note that the values are |scaled| integers. Hence \MP\ can no longer be used after the year 32767.

given node |p|, illustrates these conventions. The token list being displayed should not begin with 
a reference count.

An additional parameter |q| is also given; this parameter is either NULL or it points to a node in
the token list where a certain magic computation takes place that will be explained later.
(Basically, |q| is non-NULL when we are printing the two-line context information at the time of an
error message; |q| marks the place corresponding to where the second line should begin.)

Unusual entries are printed in the form of all-caps tokens preceded by a space, e.g., |BAD|. We go 
for a spacy layout because we have more screen real estate today.

An attribute node is three words long. Two of these words contain |type| and |value| fields as
described above, and the third word contains additional information: There is an |hashloc| field,
which contains the hash address of the token that names this attribute; and there's also a |parent|
field, which points to the value node of |mp_structured| type at the next higher level (i.e., at the
level to which this attribute is subsidiary). The |name_type| in an attribute node is |attr|. The
|link| field points to the next attribute with the same parent; these are arranged in increasing
order, so that |mp_get_hashloc (mp_link(p)) > mp_get_hashloc (p)|. The final attribute node links to
the constant |end_attr|, whose |hashloc| field is greater than any legal hash address. The
|attr_head| in the parent points to a node whose |name_type| is |mp_structured_root_operation|; this
node represents the NULL attribute, i.e., the variable that is relevant when no attributes are
attached to the parent. The |attr_head| node has the fields of either a value node, a subscript node,
or an attribute node, depending on what the parent would be if it were not structured; but the
subscript and attribute fields are ignored, so it effectively contains only the data of a value node.
The |link| field in this special node points to an attribute node whose |hashloc| field is zero; the
latter node represents a collective subscript |[]| attached to the parent, and its |link| field
points to the first non-special attribute node (or to |end_attr| if there are none).

A subscript node likewise occupies three words, with |type| and |value| fields plus extra
information; its |name_type| is |subscr|. In this case the third word is called the |subscript|
field, which is a |scaled| integer. The |link| field points to the subscript node with the next
larger subscript, if any; otherwise the |link| points to the attribute node for collective subscripts
at this level. We have seen that the latter node contains an upward pointer, so that the parent can
be deduced.

The |name_type| in a parent-less value node is |root|, and the |link| is the hash address of the
token that names this value.

In other words, variables have a hierarchical structure that includes enough threads running around
so that the program is able to move easily between siblings, parents, and children. An example should
be helpful: (The reader is advised to draw a picture while reading the following description, since
that will help to firm up the ideas.) Suppose that |x| and |x.a| and |x[]b| and |x5| and |x20b| have
been mentioned in a user's program, where |x[]b| has been declared to be of |boolean| type. Let
|h(x)|, |h(a)|, and |h(b)| be the hash addresses of \.x, \.a, and~\.b. Then |eq_type(h(x)) = name|
and |equiv(h(x)) = p|, where |p|~is a non-symbolic value node with |mp_name_type(p) = root| and
|mp_link(p) = h(x)|. We have |type(p) = mp_structured|, |mp_get_attribute_head(p) = q|, and
|mp_get_subscr_head(p) = r|, where |q| points to a value node and |r| to a subscript node. (Are you
still following this? Use a pencil to draw a diagram.) The lone variable |x| is represented by
|type(q)| and |value(q)|; furthermore |mp_name_type(q) = mp_structured_root_operation| and
|mp_link(q) = q1|, where |q1| points to an attribute node representing |x[]|. Thus |mp_name_type(q1)
= attr|, |mp_get_hashloc(q1) = mp_collective_subscript = 0|, |mp_get_parent(q1) = p|, |type(q1) =
mp_structured|, |mp_get_attribute_head(q1) = qq|, and |mp_get_subscr_head(q1) = qq1|; |qq| is a
three-word \quote {attribute-as-value} node with |type(qq) = numeric_type| (assuming that |x5| is
numeric, because |qq| represents |x[]| with no further attributes), |mp_name_type(qq) =
structured_root|, |mp_get_hashloc(qq)=0|, |mp_get_parent(qq) = p|, and |mp_link(qq) = qq1|. (Now pay
attention to the next part.) Node |qq1| is an attribute node representing |x[][]|, which has never
yet occurred; its |type| field is |undefined|, and its |value| field is undefined. We have
|mp_name_type(qq1) = attr|, |mp_get_hashloc(qq1) = mp_collective_subscript|, |mp_get_parent(qq1) = 
q1|, and |mp_link(qq1) = qq2|. Since |qq2| represents |x[]b|, |type(qq2) = mp_unknown_boolean|; also
|mp_get_hashloc(qq2) = h(b)|, |mp_get_parent(qq2) = q1|, |mp_name_type(qq2) = attr|, |mp_link(qq2) =
end_attr|. (Maybe colored lines will help untangle your picture.) Node |r| is a subscript node with
|type| and |value| representing |x5|; |mp_name_type(r) = subscr|, |subscript(r) = 5.0|, and
|mp_link(r) = r1| is another subscript node. To complete the picture, see if you can guess what
|mp_link(r1)| is; give up? It's~|q1|. Furthermore |subscript(r1) = 20.0|, |mp_name_type(r1) =
subscr|, |type(r1) = mp_structured|, |mp_get_attribute_head(r1) = qqq|, |mp_get_subscr_head(r1) =
qqq1|, and we finish things off with three more nodes |qqq|, |qqq1|, and |qqq2| hung onto~|r1|.
(Perhaps you should start again with a larger sheet of paper.) The value of variable |x20b| appears
in node~|qqq2|, as you can well imagine.

If the example in the previous paragraph doesn't make things crystal clear, a glance at some of the
simpler subroutines below will reveal how things work out in practice.

The only really unusual thing about these conventions is the use of collective subscript attributes.
The idea is to avoid repeating a lot of type information when many elements of an array are identical
macros (for which distinct values need not be stored) or when they don't have all of the possible
attributes. Branches of the structure below collective subscript attributes do not carry actual
values except for macro identifiers; branches of the structure below subscript nodes do not carry
significant information in their collective subscript attributes.

/*tex

The |find_variable| routine is given a pointer~|t| to a nonempty token list of suffixes; it returns a
pointer to the corresponding non-symbolic value. For example, if |t| points to token |x| followed by
a numeric token containing the value 7, |find_variable| finds where the value of |x7| is stored in
memory. This may seem a simple task, and it usually is, except when |x7| has never been referenced
before. Indeed, |x| may never have even been subscripted before; complexities arise with respect to
updating the collective subscript information.

If a macro type is detected anywhere along path~|t|, or if the first item on |t| isn't a |tag_token|,
the value |NULL| is returned. Otherwise |p| will be a non-NULL pointer to a node such that 
|undefined < type(p) < mp_structured|.

Saving and restoring equivalents

The nested structure given by |begingroup| and |endgroup| allows |eqtb| entries to be saved and
restored, so that temporary changes can be made without difficulty. When the user requests a current
value to be saved, \MP\ puts that value into its \quote {save stack.} An appearance of |endgroup|
ultimately causes the old values to be removed from the save stack and put back in their former
places.

The save stack is a linked list containing three kinds of entries, distinguished by their |type|
fields. If |p| points to a saved item, then

\startitem
    |p->type = 0| stands for a group boundary; each |begingroup| contributes such an item to the save
    stack and each |endgroup| cuts back the stack until the most recent such entry has been removed.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |p->type = mp_normal_operation| means that |p->value| holds the former contents of |eqtb[q]|
    (saved in the |knot| field of the value, which is otherwise unused for variables). Such save
    stack entries are generated by |save| commands.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |p->type = mp_internal_operation| means that |p->value| is a |mp_internal| to be restored to
    internal parameter number~|q| (saved in the |serial| field of the value, which is otherwise
    unused for internals). Such entries are generated by |interim| commands.
\stopitem

\stopitemize

The global variable |save_ptr| points to the top item on the save stack.

Choosing control points

Now we must actually delve into one of \MP's more difficult routines, the |make_choices| procedure
that chooses angles and control points for the splines of a curve when the user has not specified
them explicitly. The parameter to |make_choices| points to a list of knots and path information, as
described above.

A path decomposes into independent segments at \quote {breakpoint} knots, which are knots whose left
and right angles are both prespecified in some way (i.e., their |mp_left_type| and |mp_right_type|
aren't both open).

When |make_choices| chooses angles, it must compute the coefficients of these linear equations, then
solve the equations. To compute the coefficients, it is necessary to compute arctangents of the given
turning angles~$\psi_k$. When the equations are solved, the chosen directions $\theta_k$ are put back
into the form of control points by essentially computing sines and cosines.

OK, we are ready to make the hard choices of |make_choices|. Most of the work is relegated to an
auxiliary procedure called |solve_choices|, which has been introduced to keep |make_choices| from
being extremely long.

It's convenient to precompute quantities that will be needed several times later. The values of
|delta_x[k]| and |delta_y[k]| will be the coordinates of $z\k-z_k$, and the magnitude of this vector
will be |delta[k]=|. The path angle $\psi_k$ between $z_k-z_{k-1}$ and $z\k-z_k$ will be stored in
|psi[k]|.

Before we can go further into the way choices are made, we need to consider the underlying theory.
The basic ideas implemented in |make_choices| are due to John Hobby, who introduced the notion of
\quote {mock curvature} at a knot. Angles are chosen so that they preserve mock curvature when a knot
is passed, and this has been found to produce excellent results.

It is convenient to introduce some notations that simplify the necessary formulas. Let
$d_{k,k+1}=\vert z\k-z_k\vert$ be the (nonzero) distance between knots |k| and |k+1|; and let

$$
{z\k-z_k\over z_k-z_{k-1}} = {d_{k,k+1}\over d_{k-1,k}}e^{i\psi_k}
$$

so that a polygonal line from $z_{k-1}$ to $z_k$ to $z\k$ turns left through an angle of $\psi_k$. 
We assume that $\vert\psi_k\vert\L180^\circ$. The control points for the spline from $z_k$ to 
$z\k$ will be denoted by

$$
\eqalign{z_k^+&=z_k+ \textstyle{1\over3}\rho_k e^{i\theta_k}(z\k-z_k),\cr z\k^-&=z\k-
\textstyle{1\over3}\sigma\k e^{-i\phi\k}(z\k-z_k),\cr}
$$

where $\rho_k$ and $\sigma\k$ are nonnegative \quote {velocity ratios} at the beginning and end of
the curve, while $\theta_k$ and $\phi\k$ are the corresponding \quote {offset angles.} These angles
satisfy the condition

$$
\theta_k+\phi_k+\psi_k=0,\eqno(*)
$$

whenever the curve leaves an intermediate knot~|k| in the direction that it enters.

Let $\alpha_k$ and $\beta\k$ be the reciprocals of the \quote {tension} of the curve at its 
beginning and ending points. This means that $\rho_k = \alpha_k f(\theta_k,\phi\k)$ and $\sigma\k =
\beta\k f(\phi\k,\theta_k)$, where $f(\theta,\phi)$ is \MP's standard velocity function defined in 
the |velocity| subroutine. The cubic spline $B(z_k^{\phantom{+}},z_k^+, z\k^-,z\k^{\phantom{+}};t)$ has
curvature

$$
{2\sigma\k\sin(\theta_k+\phi\k)-6\sin\theta_k\over\rho_k^2d_{k,k+1}} \qquad{\rm and}\qquad
{2\rho_k\sin(\theta_k+\phi\k)-6\sin\phi\k\over\sigma\k^2d_{k,k+1}}
$$

at |t=0| and |t=1|, respectively. The mock curvature is the linear approximation to this true
curvature that arises in the limit for small $\theta_k$ and~$\phi\k$, if second-order terms are
discarded. The standard velocity function satisfies

$$
f(\theta,\phi)=1+O(\theta^2+\theta\phi+\phi^2);
$$ 

hence the mock curvatures are respectively

$$
{2\beta\k(\theta_k+\phi\k)-6\theta_k\over\alpha_k^2d_{k,k+1}} \qquad{\rm and}\qquad
{2\alpha_k(\theta_k+\phi\k)-6\phi\k\over\beta\k^2d_{k,k+1}}.\eqno(**)
$$

The turning angles $\psi_k$ are given, and equation $(*)$ above determines $\phi_k$ when $\theta_k$
is known, so the task of angle selection is essentially to choose appropriate values for each
$\theta_k$. When equation~$(*)$ is used to eliminate $\phi$~variables from $(**)$, we obtain a system
of linear equations of the form

$$
A_k\theta_{k-1}+(B_k+C_k)\theta_k+D_k\theta\k=-B_k\psi_k-D_k\psi\k,
$$

where

$$
A_k={\alpha_{k-1}\over\beta_k^2d_{k-1,k}}, \qquad
B_k={3-\alpha_{k-1}\over\beta_k^2d_{k-1,k}}, \qquad
C_k={3-\beta\k\over\alpha_k^2d_{k,k+1}}, \qquad
D_k={\beta\k\over\alpha_k^2d_{k,k+1}}.
$$

The tensions are always $3\over4$ or more, hence each $\alpha$ and~$\beta$ will be at most $4\over3$.
It follows that $B_k|5\over4|A_k$ and $C_k|5\over4|D_k$; hence the equations are diagonally dominant;
hence they have a unique solution. Moreover, in most cases the tensions are equal to~1, so that
$B_k = 2A_k$ and $C_k = 2D_k$. This makes the solution numerically stable, and there is an 
exponential damping effect: The data at knot $k\pm j$ affects the angle at knot $k$ by a factor of
$O(2^{-j})$.

However, we still must consider the angles at the starting and ending knots of a non-cyclic path.
These angles might be given explicitly, or they might be specified implicitly in terms of an amount
of \quote {curl.}

Let's assume that angles need to be determined for a non-cyclic path starting at $z_0$ and ending
at~$z_n$. Then equations of the form

$$
A_k\theta_{k-1}+(B_k+C_k)\theta_k+D_k\theta_{k+1}=R_k
$$

have been given for $0<k<n$, and it will be convenient to introduce equations of the same form for
$k=0$ and $k=n$, where

$$
A_0=B_0=C_n=D_n=0.
$$

If $\theta_0$ is supposed to have a given value $E_0$, we simply define $C_0 = 1$, $D_0 = 0$, and
$R_0=E_0$. Otherwise a curl parameter, $\gamma_0$, has been specified at~$z_0$; this means that the
mock curvature at $z_0$ should be $\gamma_0$ times the mock curvature at $z_1$; i.e.,

$$
{2\beta_1(\theta_0+\phi_1)-6\theta_0\over\alpha_0^2d_{01}}
=\gamma_0{2\alpha_0(\theta_0+\phi_1)-6\phi_1\over\beta_1^2d_{01}}.
$$

This equation simplifies to

$$
(\alpha_0\chi_0+3-\beta_1)\theta_0+ \bigl((3-\alpha_0)\chi_0+\beta_1\bigr)\theta_1=
-\bigl((3-\alpha_0)\chi_0+\beta_1\bigr)\psi_1,
$$

where $\chi_0 = \alpha_0^2\gamma_0 / \beta_1^2$; so we can set $C_0 = \chi_0\alpha_0 + 3-\beta_1$,
$D_0 = (3-\alpha_0)\chi_0 + \beta_1$, $R_0 = -D_0\psi_1$. It can be shown that $C_0 > 0$ and
$C_0B_1-A_1D_0 > 0$ when $\gamma_0\G0$, hence the linear equations remain nonsingular.

Similar considerations apply at the right end, when the final angle $\phi_n$ may or may not need to
be determined. It is convenient to let $\psi_n=0$, hence $\theta_n = -\phi_n$. We either have an
explicit equation $\theta_n = E_n$, or we have

$$
\bigl((3-\beta_n)\chi_n+\alpha_{n-1}\bigr)\theta_{n-1}+
(\beta_n\chi_n+3-\alpha_{n-1})\theta_n=0,\qquad \chi_n={\beta_n^2\gamma_n\over\alpha_{n-1}^2}.
$$

/*tex

Linear equations need to be solved whenever |n>1|; and also when |n=1| and exactly one of the
breakpoints involves a curl. The simplest case occurs when |n=1| and there is a curl at both
breakpoints; then we simply draw a straight line.

But before coding up the simple cases, we might as well face the general case, since we must deal
with it sooner or later, and since the general case is likely to give some insight into the way
simple cases can be handled best.

When there is no cycle, the linear equations to be solved form a tridiagonal system, and we can 
apply the standard technique of Gaussian elimination to convert that system to a sequence of 
equations of the form

$$
\theta_0+u_0\theta_1=v_0,\quad \theta_1+u_1\theta_2=v_1,\quad\ldots,\quad
\theta_{n-1}+u_{n-1}\theta_n=v_{n-1},\quad \theta_n=v_n.
$$

It is possible to do this diagonalization while generating the equations. Once $\theta_n$ is known,
it is easy to determine $\theta_{n-1}$, \dots, $\theta_1$, $\theta_0$; thus, the equations will be
solved.

The procedure is slightly more complex when there is a cycle, but the basic idea will be nearly the
same. In the cyclic case the right-hand sides will be $v_k + w_k\theta_0$ instead of simply $v_k$, 
and we will start the process off with $u_0 = v_0 = 0$, $w_0 = 1$. The final equation will be not
$\theta_n = v_n$ but $\theta_n + u_n\theta_1 = v_n+w_n\theta_0$; an appropriate ending routine will
take account of the fact that $\theta_n=\theta_0$ and eliminate the $w$'s from the system, after 
which the solution can be obtained as before.

When $u_k$, $v_k$, and $w_k$ are being computed, the three pointer variables |r|, |s|,~|t| will point
respectively to knots |k-1|, |k|, and |k+1|. The $u$'s and $w$'s are scaled by $2^{28}$, i.e., they
are of type |fraction|; the $\theta$'s and $v$'s are of type |angle|.

                            as derived above. We want to combine this with the already-derived 
                            equation $\theta_{k-1}+u_{k-1}\theta_k=v_{k-1}+w_{k-1}\theta_0$ in order 
                            to obtain a new equation $\theta_k+u_k\theta\k=v_k+w_k\theta_0$. This 
                            can be done by dividing the equation

                            $$
                            (B_k-u_{k-1}A_k+C_k)\theta_k+D_k\theta\k=-B_k\psi_k-D_k\psi\k-A_kv_{k-1}

                            by $B_k-u_{k-1}A_k + C_k$. The trick is to do this carefully with 
                            fixed-point arithmetic, avoiding the chance of overflow while retaining 
                            suitable precision.

\MP's |llcorner|, |lrcorner|, |ulcorner|, and |urcorner| operators allow the user to measure the
bounding box of anything that can go into a picture. It's easy to get rough bounds on the $x$ and $y$
extent of a path by just finding the bounding box of the knots and the control points. We need a more
accurate version of the bounding box, but we can still use the easy estimate to save time by focusing
on the interesting parts of the path.

Computing an accurate bounding box involves a theme that will come up again and again. Given a
Bernshte{\u\i}n polynomial

$$
B(z_0,z_1,\ldots,z_n;t)=\sum_k{n\choose k}t^k(1-t)^{n-k}z_k,
$$

we can conveniently bisect its range as follows:

\startitemize

\startitem
    Let $z_k^{(0)}=z_k$, for |0<=k<=n|.
\stopitem

\startitem
    Let $z_k^{(j+1)}={1\over2}(z_k^{(j)}+z\k^{(j)})$, for |0<=k<n-j|, for |0<=j<n|.
\stopitem

\stoptitemize

Then

Another important way to measure a path is to find its arc length. This is best done by using the
general bisection algorithm to subdivide the path until obtaining \quote {well behaved} subpaths
whose arc lengths can be approximated by simple means.

Since the arc length is the integral with respect to time of the magnitude of the velocity, it is
natural to use Simpson's rule for the approximation. If $\dot B(t)$ is the spline velocity, Simpson's
rule gives

$$ 
\vb\dot B(0)\vb + 4\vb\dot B({1\over2})\vb + \vb\dot B(1)\vb \over 6 
$$

for the arc length of a path of length~1. For a cubic spline $B(z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3;t)$, the time
derivative $\dot B(t)$ is $3B(dz_0,dz_1,dz_2;t)$, where $dz_i=z_{i+1}-z_i$. Hence the arc length
approximation is

$$ 
{\vb dz_0\vb \over 2} + 2\vb dz_{02}\vb + {\vb dz_2\vb \over 2}, 
$$

where

$$ 
dz_{02}={1\over2}\left({dz_0+dz_1\over 2}+{dz_1+dz_2\over 2}\right)
$$

is the result of the bisection algorithm.

The remaining problem is how to decide when a subpath is \quote {well behaved.} This could be done
via the theoretical error bound for Simpson's rule, but this is impractical because it requires an
estimate of the fourth derivative of the quantity being integrated. It is much easier to just perform
a bisection step and see how much the arc length estimate changes. Since the error for Simpson's rule
is proportional to the fourth power of the sample spacing, the remaining error is typically about
$1\over16$ of the amount of the change. We say \quote {typically} because the error has a
pseudo-random behavior that could cause the two estimates to agree when each contain large errors.

To protect against disasters such as undetected cusps, the bisection process should always continue
until all the $dz_i$ vectors belong to a single $90^\circ$ sector. This ensures that no point on the
spline can have velocity less than 70\% of the minimum of $\vb dz_0\vb$, $\vb dz_1\vb$ and $\vb
dz_2\vb$. If such a spline happens to produce an erroneous arc length estimate that is little changed
by bisection, the amount of the error is likely to be fairly small. We will try to arrange things so
that freak accidents of this type do not destroy the inverse relationship between the |arclength| and
|arctime| operations.

The |arclength| and |arctime| operations are both based on a recursive function that finds the arc
length of a cubic spline given $dz_0$, $dz_1$, $dz_2$. This |arc_test| routine also takes an arc
length goal |a_goal| and returns the time when the arc length reaches |a_goal| if there is such a
time. Thus the return value is either an arc length less than |a_goal| or, if the arc length would be
at least |a_goal|, it returns a time value decreased by |two|. This allows the caller to use the sign
of the result to distinguish between arc lengths and time values. On certain types of overflow, it is
possible for |a_goal| and the result of |arc_test| both to be |EL_GORDO|. Otherwise, the result is
always less than |a_goal|.

Rather than halving the control point coordinates on each recursive call to |arc_test|, it is better
to keep them proportional to velocity on the original curve and halve the results instead. This means
that recursive calls can potentially use larger error tolerances in their arc length estimates. How
much larger depends on to what extent the errors behave as though they are independent of each other.
To save computing time, we use optimistic assumptions and increase the tolerance by a factor of about
$\sqrt2$ for each recursive call.

In addition to the tolerance parameter, |arc_test| should also have parameters for ${1\over3}\vb\dot
B(0)\vb$, ${2\over3}\vb\dot B({1\over2})\vb$, and ${1\over3}\vb\dot B(1)\vb$. These quantities are
relatively expensive to compute and they are needed in different instances of |arc_test|.

                This construction allows us to find the time when the arc length reaches |a_goal|

A Pen in \MP\ can be either elliptical or polygonal. Elliptical pens result in \ps\ |stroke|
commands, while anything drawn with a polygonal pen is converted into an area fill as described in
the next part of this program. The mathematics behind this process is based on simple aspects of the
theory of tracings developed by Leo Guibas, Lyle Ramshaw, and Jorge Stolfi [\quote {A kinematic
framework for computational geometry,} Proc.\ IEEE Symp.\ Foundations of Computer Science {\bf 24}
(1983), 100--111].

Polygonal pens are created from paths via \MP's |makepen| primitive. This path representation is
almost sufficient for our purposes except that a pen path should always be a convex polygon with the
vertices in counter-clockwise order. Since we will need to scan pen polygons both forward and
backward, a pen should be represented as a doubly linked ring of knot nodes. There is room for the
extra back pointer because we do not need the |mp_left_type| or |mp_right_type| fields. In fact, we
don't need the |left_x|, |left_y|, |right_x|, or |right_y| fields either but we leave these alone so
that certain procedures can operate on both pens and paths. In particular, pens can be copied using
|copy_path| and recycled using |toss_knot_list|.

If the polygon being returned by |make_pen| has only one vertex, it will be interpreted as an
elliptical pen. This is no problem since a degenerate polygon can equally well be thought of as a
degenerate ellipse. We need only initialize the |left_x|, |left_y|, |right_x|, and |right_y| fields.

the pen shape and we need to compensate for this. Since there is no unique scale factor for an

be the initial $y$~coordinate of the first pen stroke. Then we implicitly project all the pen stroke
paths onto the line $y=y_0$ and require that there be no retracing. If the resulting paths cover a
range of $x$~coordinates of length $\Delta x$, we set |dash_y(h)| to the length of the dash pattern
by finding the maximum of $\Delta x$ and the absolute value of~$y_0$.

We also need to check for the case where the segment from |qq| to |rr| is monotone in $x$ but is

We get here when the argument is a NULL picture or when there is an error. Recovering from an error
involves making |mp_get_dash_list(h)| empty to indicate that |h| is not known to be a valid dash
pattern. We also dereference |h| since it is not being used for the return value.Having carefully
saved the dashed stroked nodes in the corresponding dash nodes, we must be prepared to break up these
dashes into smaller dashes.

The name of this module is a bit of a lie because we just find the first |dd| where |take_scaled(hsf,
stop_x(dd))| is large enough to make an overlap possible. It could be that the unoffset version of
dash |dln| falls in the gap between |dd| and its predecessor.

At this point we already know that |start_x(dln)<=xoff+take_scaled(hsf,stop_x(dd))|.The next major
task is to update the bounding box information in an edge header~|h|. This is done via a procedure
|adjust_bbox| that enlarges an edge header's bounding box to accommodate the box computed by

The direction of a cubic $B(z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3;t) = \bigl(x(t),y(t)\bigr)$ can be calculated from the
quadratic polynomials ${1\over3}x'(t) = B(x_1 - x_0,x_2 - x_1,x_3 - x_2;t)$ and ${1\over3}y'(t) = 
B(y_1 - y_0,y_2 - y_1,y_3 - y_2;t)$. Since we may be calculating directions from several cubics 
split from the current one, it is desirable to do these calculations without losing too much
precision. \quote {Scaled up} values of the derivatives, which will be less tainted by accumulated
errors than derivatives found from the cubics themselves, are maintained in local variables |x0|,
|x1|, and |x2|, representing $X_0 = 2^l(x_1 - x_0)$, $X_1 = 2^l(x_2 - x_1)$, and $X_2 = 2^l(x_3 - 
x_2)$; similarly |y0|, |y1|, and~|y2| represent $Y_0 = 2^l(y_1 - y_0)$, $Y_1 = 2^l(y_2 - y_1)$, and
$Y_2 = 2^l(y_3 - y_2)$.

Let us first solve a special case of the problem: Suppose we know an index~$k$ such that either

\startitemize[r,packed]
\startitem 
    $d(t)\succeq d_{k-1}$ for all~$t$ and $d(0)\prec d_k$, or 
\stopitem 
\startitem 
  (ii)~$d(t)\preceq d_k$ for all~$t$
\stopitem 
\stopitemize

and $d(0) \succ d_{k-1}$. Then, in a sense, we're halfway done, since one of the two relations in 
$(*)$ is satisfied, and the other couldn't be satisfied for any other value of~|k|. Actually, the 
conditions can be relaxed somewhat since a relation such as

$d(t)\succeq d_{k - 1}$ restricts $d(t)$ to a half plane when all that really matters is whether 
$d(t)$ crosses the ray in the $d_{k - 1}$ direction from the origin. The condition for case~(i) 
becomes $d_{k - 1} \preceq d(0) \prec d_k$ and $d(t)$ never crosses the $d_{k - 1}$ ray in the 
clockwise direction. Case~(ii) is similar except $d(t)$ cannot cross the $d_k$ ray in the 
counterclockwise direction.

The |fin_offset_prep| subroutine solves the stated subproblem. It has a parameter called |rise| that
is |1| in case~(i), |-1| in case~(ii). Parameters |x0| through |y2| represent the derivative of the
cubic following |p|. The |w| parameter should point to offset~$w_k$ and |mp_info(p)| should already
be set properly. The |turn_amt| parameter gives the absolute value of the overall net change in pen
offsets.

We want $B(|t0|,|t1|,|t2|;t)$ to be the dot product of $d(t)$ with a $-90^\circ$ rotation of the
vector from |w| to |ww|. This makes the resulting function cross from positive to negative when
$d_{k-1}\preceq d(t)\preceq d_k$ begins to fail.

The curve has crossed $d_k$ or $d_{k-1}$; its initial segment satisfies $(*)$, and it might cross
again and return towards $s_{k-1}$ or $s_k$, respectively, yielding another solution of $(*)$.

Now we must consider the general problem of |offset_prep|, when nothing is known about a given cubic.
We start by finding its direction in the vicinity of |t=0|.

If $z'(t) = 0$, the given cubic is numerically unstable but |offset_prep| has not yet introduced any
more numerical errors. Thus we can compute the true initial direction for the given cubic, even if it
is almost degenerate.

The next step is to bracket the initial direction between consecutive edges of the pen polygon. We
must be careful to turn clockwise only if this makes the turn less than $180^\circ$. (A $180^\circ$
turn must be counter-clockwise in order to make |doublepath| envelopes come out right.) This code
depends on |w0| being the offset for |(dxin,dyin)|.

Decide how many pen offsets to go away from |w| in order to find the offset for |(dx,dy)|, going
counterclockwise if |ccw| is |true|. This assumes that |w| is the offset for some direction 
$(x',y')$ from which the angle to |(dx,dy)| in the sense determined by |ccw| is less than or equal
to $180^\circ$.

If the pen polygon has only two edges, they could both be parallel to |(dx,dy)|. In this case, we
must be careful to stop after crossing the first such edge in order to avoid an infinite loop.

When we're all done, the final offset is |w0| and the final curve direction is |(dxin,dyin)|. With
this knowledge of the incoming direction at |c|, we can correct |mp_info(c)| which was erroneously
based on an incoming offset of~|h|.Finally we want to reduce the general problem to situations that
|fin_offset_prep| can handle. We split the cubic into at most three parts with respect to $d_{k-1}$,
and apply |fin_offset_prep| to each part.

At this point, the direction of the incoming pen edge is |(-du,-dv)|. When the component of $d(t)$
perpendicular to |(-du,-dv)| crosses zero, we need to decide whether the directions are parallel or
antiparallel. We can test this by finding the dot product of $d(t)$ and |(-du,-dv)|, but this should
be avoided when the value of |turn_amt| already determines the answer. If |t2 < 0|, there is one
crossing and it is antiparallel only if |turn_amt >= 0|. If |turn_amt < 0|, there should always be at
least one crossing and the first crossing cannot be antiparallel.If the cubic almost has a cusp, it
is a numerically ill-conditioned problem to decide which way it loops around but that's OK as long
we're consistent. To make |doublepath| envelopes work properly, reversing the path should always
change the sign of |turn_amt|. We check rotation direction by looking at the vector connecting the
current node with the next. If its angle with incoming and outgoing tangents has the same sign, we
pick this as |d_sign|, since it means we have a flex, not a cusp. Otherwise we proceed to the cusp
code.In order to be invariant under path reversal, the result of this computation should not change
when |x0|, |y0|, $\ldots$ are all negated and |(x0,y0)| is then swapped with |(x2,y2)|. We make use
of the identities |take_fraction(-a,-b) = take_fraction(a,b)| and |t_of_the_way(-a,-b) = -
(t_of_the_way(a,b))|.Here's a routine that prints an envelope spec in symbolic form. It assumes that
the |cur_pen| has not been walked around to the first offset.

Once we have an envelope spec, the remaining task to construct the actual envelope by offsetting each
cubic as determined by the |info| fields in the knots. First we use |offset_prep| to convert the |c|
into an envelope spec. Then we add the offsets so that |c| becomes a cyclic path that represents the
envelope.

The |linejoin| and |miterlimit| parameters control the treatment of points where the pen offset
changes, and |linecap| controls the endpoints of a |doublepath|. The endpoints are easily located
because |c| is given in undoubled form and then doubled in this procedure. We use |spec_p1| and
|spec_p2| to keep track of the endpoints and treat them like very sharp corners. Butt end caps are
treated like beveled joins; round end caps are treated like round joins; and square end caps are
achieved by setting |join_type:=3|.

None of these parameters apply to inside joins where the convolution tracing has retrograde lines. In
such cases we use a simple connect-the-endpoints approach that is achieved by setting |join_type:=2|.

The dot product of the vector from |w0| to |ww| with |(ht_x,ht_y)| ranges from zero to |max_ht|.

In degenerate situations we might have to look at the knot preceding~|q|. That knot is |p| but if
|p<>c|, its coordinates have already been offset by |w|. If |q = c| then the coordinates of |r| and 
the control points between |q| and~|r| have already been offset by |h|.Direction and intersection
times

A path of length $n$ is defined parametrically by functions $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, for |0 <= t <= n|; 
we can regard $t$ as the \quote {time} at which the path reaches the point $\bigl(x(t),y(t)\bigr)$. In this
section of the program we shall consider operations that determine special times associated with
given paths: the first time that a path travels in a given direction, and a pair of times at which
two paths cross each other.

Let's start with the easier task. The function |find_direction_time| is given a direction |(x,y)| and
a path starting at~|h|. If the path never travels in direction |(x,y)|, the direction time will
be~|-1|; otherwise it will be nonnegative.

Certain anomalous cases can arise: If |(x,y) = (0,0)|, so that the given direction is undefined, the
direction time will be~0. If $\bigl(x'(t), y'(t)\bigr) = (0,0)$, so that the path direction is
undefined, it will be assumed to match any given direction at time~|t|.

The routine solves this problem in nondegenerate cases by rotating the path and the given direction
so that |(x,y) = (1,0)|; i.e., the main task will be to find when a given path first travels \quote
{due east.}

\MP\ users define variables implicitly by stating equations that should be satisfied; the computer is
supposed to be smart enough to solve those equations. And indeed, the computer tries valiantly to do
so, by distinguishing five different types of numeric values:

\startitemize

\startitem
    |type(p) = mp_known| is the nice case, when |value(p)| is the |scaled| value of the variable 
    whose address is~|p|.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |type(p)=mp_dependent| means that |value(p)| is not present, but |mp_get_dep_list(p)| points to 
    a {\sl dependency list} that expresses the value of variable~|p| as a |scaled| number plus a sum 
    of independent variables with |fraction| coefficients.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |type(p) = mp_independent| means that |mp_get_indep_value(p)=s|, where |s>0| is a \quote {serial
    number} reflecting the time this variable was first used in an equation; and there is an extra
    field |mp_get_indep_scale(p) = m|, with |0 <= m <64|, each dependent variable that refers to 
    this one is actually referring to the future value of this variable times~$2^m$. (Usually 
    |m = 0|, but higher degrees of scaling are sometimes needed to keep the coefficients in 
    dependency lists from getting too large. The value of~|m| will always be even.)
\stopitem

\startitem
    |type(p) = mp_numeric_type| means that variable |p| hasn't appeared in an equation before, but it
    has been explicitly declared to be numeric.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |type(p) = undefined| means that variable |p| hasn't appeared
before.
\stopitem

\stopitemize

We have actually discussed these five types in the reverse order of their history during a
computation: Once |known|, a variable never again becomes |dependent|; once |dependent|, it almost
never again becomes |mp_independent|; once |mp_independent|, it never again becomes
|mp_numeric_type|; and once |mp_numeric_type|, it never again becomes |undefined| (except of course
when the user specifically decides to scrap the old value and start again). A backward step may,
however, take place: Sometimes a |dependent| variable becomes |mp_independent| again, when one of the
independent variables it depends on is reverting to |undefined|.

Variables of numeric type are maintained by the general scheme of independent, dependent, and known
values that we have just studied; and the components of pair and transform variables are handled in
the same way. But \MP\ also has five other types of values: |boolean|, |string|, |pen|, |path|, and
|picture|; what about them?

Equations are allowed between nonlinear quantities, but only in a simple form. Two variables that
haven't yet been assigned values are either equal to each other, or they're not.

Before a boolean variable has received a value, its type is |mp_unknown_boolean|; similarly, there
are variables whose type is |mp_unknown_string|, |mp_unknown_pen|, |mp_unknown_path|, and
|mp_unknown_picture|. In such cases the value is either |NULL| (which means that no other variables
are equivalent to this one), or it points to another variable of the same undefined type. The
pointers in the latter case form a cycle of nodes, which we shall call a \quote {ring.} Rings of
undefined variables may include capsules, which arise as intermediate results within expressions or
as |expr| parameters to macros.

When one member of a ring receives a value, the same value is given to all the other members. In the
case of paths and pictures, this implies making separate copies of a potentially large data
structure; users should restrain their enthusiasm for such generality, unless they have lots and lots
of memory space.

The following procedure is called when a capsule node is being added to a ring (e.g., when an unknown
variable is mentioned in an expression).

Let's pause a moment now and try to look at the Big Picture. The \MP\ program consists of three main
parts: syntactic routines, semantic routines, and output routines. The chief purpose of the syntactic
routines is to deliver the user's input to the semantic routines, while parsing expressions and
locating operators and operands. The semantic routines act as an interpreter responding to these
operators, which may be regarded as commands. And the output routines are periodically called on to
produce compact font descriptions that can be used for typesetting or for making interim proof
drawings. We have discussed the basic data structures and many of the details of semantic operations,
so we are good and ready to plunge into the part of \MP\ that actually controls the activities.

Our current goal is to come to grips with the |get_next| procedure, which is the keystone of \MP's
input mechanism. Each call of |get_next| sets the value of three variables |cur_cmd|, |cur_mod|, and
|cur_sym|, representing the next input token.

\starttabulate 
\NC |cur_cmd| \NC denotes a command code from the long list of codes given earlier \NC \NR
\NC |cur_mod| \NC denotes a modifier or operand of the command code \NC \NR
\NC |cur_sym| \NC is the hash address of the symbolic token that was just scanned \NC \NR
\NC zero      \NC in the case of a numeric or string or capsule token \NC \NR
\stoptabulate 

Underlying this external behavior of |get_next| is all the machinery necessary to convert from
character files to tokens. At a given time we may be only partially finished with the reading of
several files (for which |input| was specified), and partially finished with the expansion of some
user-defined macros and/or some macro parameters, and partially finished reading some text that the
user has inserted online, and so on. When reading a character file, the characters must be converted
to tokens; comments and blank spaces must be removed, numeric and string tokens must be evaluated.

To handle these situations, which might all be present simultaneously, \MP\ uses various stacks that
hold information about the incomplete activities, and there is a finite state control for each level
of the input mechanism. These stacks record the current state of an implicitly recursive process, but
the |get_next| procedure is not recursive.

Thus, the \quote {current input state} can be very complicated indeed; there can be many levels and
each level can arise in a variety of ways. The |show_context| procedure, which is used by \MP's
error-reporting routine to print out the current input state on all levels down to the most recent
line of characters from an input file, illustrates most of these conventions. The global variable
|file_ptr| contains the lowest level that was displayed by this procedure.The status at each level is
indicated by printing two lines, where the first line indicates what was read so far and the second
line shows what remains to be read. Non-current input levels whose |token_type| is |backed_up| are
shown only if they have not been fully read.

The heart of \MP's input mechanism is the |get_next| procedure, which we shall develop in the next
few sections of the program. Perhaps we shouldn't actually call it the \quote {heart,} however; it
really acts as \MP's eyes and mouth, reading the source files and gobbling them up. And it also helps
\MP\ to regurgitate stored token lists that are to be processed again.

The main duty of |get_next| is to input one token and to set |cur_cmd| and |cur_mod| to that token's
command code and modifier. Furthermore, if the input token is a symbolic token, that token's |hash|
address is stored in |cur_sym|; otherwise |cur_sym| is set to zero.

Underlying this simple description is a certain amount of complexity because of all the cases that
need to be handled. However, the inner loop of |get_next| is reasonably short and fast.

Before getting into |get_next|, we need to consider a mechanism by which \MP\ helps keep errors from
propagating too far. Whenever the program goes into a mode where it keeps calling |get_next|
repeatedly until a certain condition is met, it sets |scanner_status| to some value other than
|normal|. Then if an input file ends, or if an |outer| symbol appears, an appropriate error recovery
will be possible.

The global variable |warning_info| helps in this error recovery by providing additional information.
For example, |warning_info| might indicate the name of a macro whose replacement text is being
scanned.

The following subroutine is called when an |outer| symbolic token has been scanned or when the end of
a file has been reached. These two cases are distinguished by |cur_sym|, which is zero at the end of
a file.

/*tex

\MP\ has a variety of ways to tuck tokens away into token lists for later use: Macros can be defined
with |def|, |vardef|, |primarydef|, etc.; repeatable code can be defined with |for|, |forever|,
|forsuffixes|. All such operations are handled by the routines in this part of the program.

The modifier part of each command code is zero for the \quote {ending delimiters} like |enddef| and
|endfor|.

Different macro-absorbing operations have different syntaxes, but they also have a lot in common.
There is a list of special symbols that are to be replaced by parameter tokens; there is a special
command code that ends the definition; the quotation conventions are identical. Therefore it makes
sense to have most of the work done by a single subroutine. That subroutine is called |scan_toks|.

The first parameter to |scan_toks| is the command code that will terminate scanning (either
|macro_def| or |iteration|).

The second parameter, |subst_list|, points to a (possibly empty) list of non-symbolic nodes whose
|info| and |value| fields specify symbol tokens before and after replacement. The list will be
returned to free storage by |scan_toks|.

The third parameter is simply appended to the token list that is built. And the final parameter tells
how many of the special operations |\#\AT!|, |\AT!|, and |\AT!\#| are to be replaced by suffix
parameters. When such parameters are present, they are called |(SUFFIX0)|, |(SUFFIX1)|, and
|(SUFFIX2)|.

Only a few command codes |<min_command| can possibly be returned by |get_t_next|; in increasing
order, they are |if_test|, |fi_or_else|, |input|, |iteration|, |repeat_loop|, |exit_test|, |relax|,
|scan_tokens|, |run_script|, |expand_after|, and |defined_macro|.

\MP\ usually gets the next token of input by saying |get_x_next|. This is like |get_t_next| except
that it keeps getting more tokens until finding |cur_cmd>=min_command|. In other words, |get_x_next|
expands macros and removes conditionals or iterations or input instructions that might be present.

It follows that |get_x_next| might invoke itself recursively. In fact, there is massive recursion,
since macro expansion can involve the scanning of arbitrarily complex expressions, which in turn
involve macro expansion and conditionals, etc.

Therefore it's necessary to declare a whole bunch of |forward| procedures at this point, and to
insert some other procedures that will be invoked by |get_x_next|.

A recursion depth counter is used to discover infinite recursions. (Near) infinite recursion is a
problem because it translates into C function calls that eat up the available call stack. A better
solution would be to depend on signal trapping, but that is problematic when Metapost is used as a
library.The limit is set at |10000|, which should be enough to allow normal usages of metapost while
preventing the most obvious crashes on most all operating systems, but the value can be raised if the
runtime system allows a larger C stack.Even better would be if the system allows discovery of the
amount of space available on the call stack.

In any case, when the limit is crossed, that is a fatal error.

Now let's consider the |macro_call| procedure, which is used to start up all user-defined macros.
Since the arguments to a macro might be expressions, |macro_call| is recursive.

The first parameter to |macro_call| points to the reference count of the token list that defines the
macro. The second parameter contains any arguments that have already been parsed (see below). The
third parameter points to the symbolic token that names the macro. If the third parameter is |NULL|,
the macro was defined by |vardef|, so its name can be reconstructed from the prefix and \quote {at}
arguments found within the second parameter.

What is this second parameter? It's simply a linked list of symbolic items, whose |info| fields point
to the arguments. In other words, if |arg_list=NULL|, no arguments have been scanned yet; otherwise
|mp_info(arg_list)| points to the first scanned argument, and |mp_link(arg_list)| points to the list
of further arguments (if any).

Arguments of type |expr| are so-called capsules, which we will discuss later when we concentrate on
expressions; they can be recognized easily because their |link| field is |void|. Arguments of type
|suffix| and |text| are token lists without reference counts.

After argument scanning is complete, the arguments are moved to the |param_stack|. (They can't be put
on that stack any sooner, because the stack is growing and shrinking in unpredictable ways as more
arguments are being acquired.) Then the macro body is fed to the scanner; i.e., the replacement text
of the macro is placed at the top of the \MP's input stack, so that |get_t_next| will proceed to read
it next.This invokes a user-defined control sequence.

Let's consider now the way |if| commands are handled.

Conditions can be inside conditions, and this nesting has a stack that is independent of other
stacks. Four global variables represent the top of the condition stack: |cond_ptr| points to
pushed-down entries, if~any; |cur_if| tells whether we are processing |if| or |elseif|; |if_limit|
specifies the largest code of a |fi_or_else| command that is syntactically legal; and |if_line| is
the line number at which the current conditional began.

If no conditions are currently in progress, the condition stack has the special state
|cond_ptr = NULL|, |if_limit = normal|, |cur_if = 0|, |if_line = 0|. Otherwise |cond_ptr| points to 
a non-symbolic node; the |type|, |name_type|, and |link| fields of the first word contain |if_limit|,
|cur_if|, and |cond_ptr| at the next level, and the second word contains the corresponding |if_line|.

It's time now to fret about file names. Besides the fact that different operating systems treat files
in different ways, we must cope with the fact that completely different naming conventions are used
by different groups of people. The following programs show what is required for one particular
operating system; similar routines for other systems are not difficult to devise.

{\em This section doesn't really apply to the library because files are mostly delegated to the main 
program but we keep some comments fo rhistoric reasons.}

\MP\ assumes that a file name has three parts: the name proper; its \quote {extension}; and a \quote
{file area} where it is found in an external file system. The extension of an input file is assumed
to be |.mp| unless otherwise specified; it is |.log| on the transcript file that records each run of
\MP; it is |.tfm| on the font metric files that describe characters in any fonts created by \MP; it
is |.ps| or |.nnn| for some number |nnn| on the \POSTSCRIPT\ output files. The file area can be
arbitrary on input files, but files are usually output to the user's current area. If an input file
cannot be found on the specified area, \MP\ will look for it on a special system area; this special
area is intended for commonly used input files.

Simple uses of \MP\ refer only to file names that have no explicit extension or area. For example, a
person usually says |input cmr10| instead of |input cmr10.new|. Simple file names are best,
because they make the \MP\ source files portable; whenever a file name consists entirely of letters
and digits, it should be treated in the same way by all implementations of \MP. However, users need
the ability to refer to other files in their environment, especially when responding to error
messages concerning unopenable files; therefore we want to let them use the syntax that appears in
their favorite operating system.

\MP\ uses the same conventions that have proved to be satisfactory for \TeX\ and \MF. In order to
isolate the system-dependent aspects of file names, the system-independent parts of \MP\ are
expressed in terms of three system-dependent procedures called |begin_name|, |more_name|, and
|end_name|. In essence, if the user-specified characters of the file name are $c_1 \ldots c_n$, the
system-independent driver program does the operations

\starttyping
|begin_name|
|more_name|(c_1) ... |more_name|(c_n)
|end_name|
\stoptyping

These three procedures communicate with each other via global variables. Afterwards the file name 
will appear in the string pool as |cur_name|.

Actually the situation is slightly more complicated, because \MP\ needs to know when the file name
ends. The |more_name| routine is a function (with side effects) that returns |true| on the calls
|more_name(c_1)|, \dots, |more_name(c_{n-1}(_)|. The final call |more_name(c_n)| returns |false|;
or, it returns |true| and $c_n$ is the last character on the current input line. In other words,
|more_name| is supposed to return |true| unless it is sure that the file name has been completely
scanned; and |end_name| is supposed to be able to finish the assembly of |cur_name| regardless of
whether $|more_name|(c_n)$ returned |true| or |false|.

It is easier to maintain reference counts if we assign initial values.

The file names we shall deal with for illustrative purposes have the following structure: If the name
contains |>| or |:|, the file area consists of all characters up to and including the final such
character; otherwise the file area is null. If the remaining file name contains |.|, the file
extension consists of all such characters from the first remaining |.| to the end, otherwise the file
extension is null.

We can scan such file names easily by using two global variables that keep track of the occurrences
of area and extension delimiters.

Here are the routines for file name scanning.

Now let's consider the \quote {driver} routines by which \MP\ deals with file names in a
system-independent manner. First comes a procedure that looks for a file name in the input by taking
the information from the input buffer. (We can't use |get_next|, because the conversion to tokens
would destroy necessary information.)

This procedure doesn't allow semicolons or percent signs to be part of file names, because of other
conventions of \MP. {\sl The {\logos METAFONT}book} doesn't use semicolons or percents immediately
after file names, but some users no doubt will find it natural to do so; therefore system-dependent
changes to allow such characters in file names should probably be made with reluctance, and only when
an entire file name that includes special characters is \quote {quoted} somehow.

Many different kinds of expressions are possible, so it is wise to have precise descriptions of what
|cur_type| and |cur_exp| mean in all cases:

\startitemize

\startitem
    |cur_type=mp_vacuous| means that this expression didn't turn out to have a value at all, because
    it arose from a |begingroup|$\,\ldots\,$|endgroup| construction in which there was no expression
    before the |endgroup|. In this case |cur_exp| has some irrelevant value.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_boolean_type| means that |cur_exp| is either |true_code| or |false_code|.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_unknown_boolean| means that |cur_exp| points to a capsule node that is in a ring
    of equivalent booleans whose value has not yet been defined.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_string_type| means that |cur_exp| is a string number (i.e., an integer in the
    range |0<=cur_exp<str_ptr|). That string's reference count includes this particular reference.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_unknown_string| means that |cur_exp| points to a capsule node that is in a ring of
    equivalent strings whose value has not yet been defined.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_pen_type| means that |cur_exp| points to a node in a pen. Nobody else points to
    any of the nodes in this pen. The pen may be polygonal or elliptical.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type=mp_unknown_pen| means that |cur_exp| points to a capsule node that is in a ring of
    equivalent pens whose value has not yet been defined.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_path_type| means that |cur_exp| points to a the first node of a path; nobody else
    points to this particular path. The control points of the path will have been chosen.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_unknown_path| means that |cur_exp| points to a capsule node that is in a ring of
    equivalent paths whose value has not yet been defined.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_picture_type| means that |cur_exp| points to an edge header node. There may be
    other pointers to this particular set of edges. The header node contains a reference count that
    includes this particular reference.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_unknown_picture| means that |cur_exp| points to a capsule node that is in a ring
    of equivalent pictures whose value has not yet been defined.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_transform_type| means that |cur_exp| points to a |mp_transform_type| capsule node.
    The |value| part of this capsule points to a transform node that contains six numeric values,
    each of which is |independent|, |dependent|, |mp_proto_dependent|, or |known|.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_color_type| means that |cur_exp| points to a |color_type| capsule node. The
    |value| part of this capsule points to a color node that contains three numeric values, each of
    which is |independent|, |dependent|, |mp_proto_dependent|, or |known|.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_cmykcolor_type| means that |cur_exp| points to a |mp_cmykcolor_type| capsule node.
    The |value| part of this capsule points to a color node that contains four numeric values, each
    of which is |independent|, |dependent|, |mp_proto_dependent|, or |known|.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_pair_type| means that |cur_exp| points to a capsule node whose type is
    |mp_pair_type|. The |value| part of this capsule points to a pair node that contains two numeric
    values, each of which is |independent|, |dependent|, |mp_proto_dependent|, or |known|.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_known| means that |cur_exp| is a |scaled| value.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_dependent| means that |cur_exp| points to a capsule node whose type is
    |dependent|. The |dep_list| field in this capsule points to the associated dependency list.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_proto_dependent| means that |cur_exp| points to a |mp_proto_dependent| capsule
    node. The |dep_list| field in this capsule points to the associated dependency list.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = independent| means that |cur_exp| points to a capsule node whose type is
    |independent|. This somewhat unusual case can arise, for example, in the expression
    `$x+|begingroup|\penalty0\,|string|\,x; 0\,|endgroup|$'.
\stopitem

\startitem
    |cur_type = mp_token_list| means that |cur_exp| points to a linked list of tokens.
\stopitem

\stopitemize

The possible settings of |cur_type| have been listed here in increasing numerical order. Notice that
|cur_type| will never be |mp_numeric_type| or |suffixed_macro| or |mp_unsuffixed_macro|, although
variables of those types are allowed. Conversely, \MP\ has no variables of type |mp_vacuous| or
|token_list|.

Capsules are non-symbolic nodes that have a similar meaning to |cur_type| and |cur_exp|. Such nodes
have |name_type=capsule|, and their |type| field is one of the possibilities for |cur_type| listed
above. Also |link <= void| in capsules that aren't part of a token list.

The |value| field of a capsule is, in most cases, the value that corresponds to its |type|, as
|cur_exp| corresponds to |cur_type|. However, when |cur_exp| would point to a capsule, no extra layer
of indirection is present; the |value| field is what would have been called |value(cur_exp)| if it
had not been encapsulated. Furthermore, if the type is |dependent| or |mp_proto_dependent|, the
|value| field of a capsule is replaced by |dep_list| and |prev_dep| fields, since dependency lists in
capsules are always part of the general |dep_list| structure.

The |get_x_next| routine is careful not to change the values of |cur_type| and |cur_exp| when it gets
an expanded token. However, |get_x_next| might call a macro, which might parse an expression, which
might execute lots of commands in a group; hence it's possible that |cur_type| might change from,
say, |mp_unknown_boolean| to |mp_boolean_type|, or from |dependent| to |known| or |independent|,
during the time |get_x_next| is called. The programs below are careful to stash sensitive
intermediate results in capsules, so that \MP's generality doesn't cause trouble.

Here's a procedure that illustrates these conventions. It takes the contents of |(cur_type, cur_exp)|
and stashes them away in a capsule. It is not used when|cur_type=mp_token_list|. After the operation, 
|cur_type = mp_vacuous|; hence there is no need to copy path lists or to update reference counts, 
etc.

The special link |MP_VOID| is put on the capsule returned by |stash_cur_exp|, because this procedure
is used to store macro parameters that must be easily distinguishable from token lists.

/*tex

The inverse of |stash_cur_exp| is the following procedure, which deletes an unnecessary capsule and
puts its contents into |cur_type| and |cur_exp|.

The program steps of \MP\ can be divided into two categories: those in which |cur_type| and |cur_exp|
are \quote {alive} and those in which they are \quote {dead,} in the sense that |cur_type| and
|cur_exp| contain relevant information or not. It's important not to ignore them when they're alive,
and it's important not to pay attention to them when they're dead.

There's also an intermediate category: If |cur_type=mp_vacuous|, then |cur_exp| is irrelevant, hence
we can proceed without caring if |cur_type| and |cur_exp| are alive or dead. In such cases we say
that |cur_type| and |cur_exp| are {\sl dormant}. It is permissible to call |get_x_next| only when
they are alive or dormant.

The |stash| procedure above assumes that |cur_type| and |cur_exp| are alive or dormant. The |unstash|
procedure assumes that they are dead or dormant; it resuscitates them.

Variables lose their former values when they appear in a type declaration, or when they are defined
to be macros or |let| equal to something else. A subroutine will be defined later that recycles the
storage associated with any particular |type| or |value|; our goal now is to study a higher level
process called |flush_variable|, which selectively frees parts of a variable structure.

This routine has some complexity because of examples such as |numeric x[]a[]b| which recycles all
variables of the form |x[i]a[j]b| (and no others), while |vardef x[]a[] = ...| discards all variables
of the form |x[i]a[j]| followed by an arbitrary suffix, except for the collective node |x[]a[]|
itself. The obvious way to handle such examples is to use recursion; so that's what we~do.

Parameter |p| points to the root information of the variable; parameter |t| points to a list of
symbolic nodes that represent suffixes, with |info = mp_collective_subscript| for subscripts.

If |cur_type| and |cur_exp| contain relevant information that should be recycled, we will use the
following procedure, which changes |cur_type| to |known| and stores a given value in |cur_exp|. We
can think of |cur_type| and |cur_exp| as either alive or dormant after this has been done, because
|cur_exp| will not contain a pointer value.

When an independent variable disappears, it simply fades away, unless something depends on it. In the
latter case, a dependent variable whose coefficient of dependence is maximal will take its place. The
relevant algorithm is due to Ignacio~A. Zabala, who implemented it as part of his Ph.n->data. thesis
(Stanford University, December 1982).

For example, suppose that variable $x$ is being recycled, and that the only variables depending
on~$x$ are $y = 2x + a$ and $z = x + b$. In this case we want to make $y$ independent and $z =
.5y - .5a + b$; no other variables will depend on~$y$. If $|tracingequations|>0$ in this situation, 
we will print |\#\#\# -2x = -y + a|.

There's a slight complication, however: An independent variable $x$ can occur both in dependency
lists and in proto-dependency lists. This makes it necessary to be careful when deciding which
coefficient is maximal.

Furthermore, this complication is not so slight when a proto-dependent variable is chosen to become
independent. For example, suppose that $y = 2x +100a$ is proto-dependent while $z = x + b$ is 
dependent; then we must change $z = .5y - 50a + b$ to a proto-dependency, because of the large 
coefficient \quote {50{'}.

In order to deal with these complications without wasting too much time, we shall link together the
occurrences of $x$ among all the linear dependencies, maintaining separate lists for the dependent
and proto-dependent cases.

The code for independency removal makes use of three non-symbolic arrays.

A global variable |var_flag| is set to a special command code just before \MP\ calls
|scan_expression|, if the expression should be treated as a variable when this command code
immediately follows. For example, |var_flag| is set to |assignment| at the beginning of a statement,
because we want to know the \quote {location} of a variable at the left of |:=|, not the \quote 
{value} of that variable.

The |scan_expression| subroutine calls |scan_tertiary|, which calls |scan_secondary|, which calls
|scan_primary|, which sets |var_flag := 0|. In this way each of the scanning routines \quote {knows}
when it has been called with a special |var_flag|, but |var_flag| is usually zero.

A variable preceding a command that equals |var_flag| is converted to a token list rather than a
value. Furthermore, an |=| sign following an expression with |var_flag=assignment| is not considered
to be a relation that produces boolean expressions.

The first parsing routine, |scan_primary|, is also the most complicated one, since it involves so
many different cases. But each case (with one exception) is fairly simple by itself.

When |scan_primary| begins, the first token of the primary to be scanned should already appear in
|cur_cmd|, |cur_mod|, and |cur_sym|. The values of |cur_type| and |cur_exp| should be either dead or
dormant, as explained earlier. If |cur_cmd| is not between |min_primary_command| and
|max_primary_command|, inclusive, a syntax error will be signaled.

Later we'll come to procedures that perform actual operations like addition, square root, and so on;
our purpose now is to do the parsing. But we might as well mention those future procedures now, so
that the suspense won't be too bad:

\startitemize

\startitem
    |do_nullary(c)| does primitive operations that have no operands (e.g., |true| or |pencircle|);
\stopitem

\startitem
    |do_unary(c)| applies a primitive operation to the current expression;
\stopitem

\startitem
    |do_binary(p,c)| applies a primitive operation to the capsule~|p| and the current
    expression.Expressions of the form |a[b,c]| are converted into |b + a*(c - b)|, without checking the
    types of |b| or |c|, provided that |a| is numeric. Errors at the beginning of expressions are
    flagged by |bad_exp|.

The most difficult part of |scan_primary| has been saved for last, since it was necessary to build up
some confidence first. We can now face the task of scanning a variable.

As we scan a variable, we build a token list containing the relevant names and subscript values,
simultaneously following along in the \quote {collective} structure to see if we are actually dealing
with a macro instead of a value.

The local variables |pre_head| and |post_head| will point to the beginning of the prefix and suffix
lists; |tail| will point to the end of the list that is currently growing.

Another local variable, |tt|, contains partial information about the declared type of the
variable-so-far. If |tt >= mp_unsuffixed_macro|, the relation |tt = mp_type(q)| will always hold. If
|tt = undefined|, the routine doesn't bother to update its information about type. And if |undefined
< tt < mp_unsuffixed_macro|, the precise value of |tt| isn't critical.

both |\AT!| and the suffix.

Our remaining job is simply to make a copy of the value that has been found. Some cases are harder
than others, but complexity arises solely because of the multiplicity of possible cases.The
|encapsulate| subroutine assumes that |dep_final| is the tail of dependency list~|p|.The |install|
procedure copies a numeric field~|q| into field~|r| of a big node that will be part of a capsule.
Here is a comparatively simple routine that is used to scan the |suffix| parameters of a macro.
Parsing secondary and higher expressions

After the intricacies of |scan_primary|, the |scan_secondary| routine is refreshingly simple. It's 
not trivial, but the operations are relatively straightforward; the main difficulty is, again, that 
expressions and data structures might change drastically every time we call |get_x_next|, so a 
cautious approach is mandatory. For example, a macro defined by |primarydef| might have disappeared 
by the time its second argument has been scanned; we solve this by increasing the reference count 
of its token list, so that the macro can be called even after it has been clobbered. The following 
procedure calls a macro that has two parameters, |p| and |cur_exp|.

/*tex

The |scan_direction| subroutine looks at the directional information that is enclosed in braces, 
and also scans ahead to the following character. A type code is returned, either |open| (if the 
direction was $(0,0)$), or |curl| (if the direction was a curl of known value |cur_exp|), or 
|given| (if the direction is given by the |angle| value that now appears in |cur_exp|).

There's nothing difficult about this subroutine, but the program is rather lengthy because a 
variety of potential errors need to be nipped in the bud.

/*tex

The purpose of parsing is primarily to permit people to avoid piles of parentheses. But the real work
is done after the structure of an expression has been recognized; that's when new expressions are
generated. We turn now to the guts of \MP, which handles individual operators that have come through
the parsing mechanism.

We'll start with the easy ones that take no operands, then work our way up to operators with one and
ultimately two arguments. In other words, we will write the three procedures |do_nullary|,
|do_unary|, and |do_binary| that are invoked periodically by the expression scanners.

First let's make sure that all of the primitive operators are in the hash table. Although
|scan_primary| and its relatives made use of the |cmd| code for these operators, the |do| routines
base everything on the |mod| code. For example, |do_binary| doesn't care whether the operation it
performs is a |primary_binary| or |secondary_binary|, etc.

/*tex

The |nice_pair| function returns |true| if both components of a pair are known.The
|nice_color_or_pair| function is analogous except that it also accepts fully known colors.

Negation is easy except when the current expression is of type |independent|, or when it is a pair
with one or more |independent| components.It is tempting to argue that the negative of an independent
variable is an independent variable, hence we don't have to do anything when negating it. The fallacy
is that other dependent variables pointing to the current expression must change the sign of their
coefficients if we make no change to the current expression.

Instead, we work around the problem by copying the current expression and recycling it afterwards
(cf.~the |stash_in| routine).If the current expression is a pair, but the context wants it to be a
path, we call |pair_to_path|.

/*tex

The |pair_value| routine changes the current expression to a given ordered pair of values.

Here is a function that sets |minx|, |maxx|, |miny|, |maxy| to the bounding box of the current
expression. The boolean result is |false| if the expression has the wrong type.Here is a routine 
that interprets |cur_exp| as a file name and tries to read a line from the file or to close the
file. The string denoting end-of-file is a one-byte string at position zero, by definition. I have 
to cheat a little here because .... CHECK

Finally, we have the operations that combine a capsule~|p| with the current expression.

Several of the binary operations are potentially complicated by the fact that |independent| values
can sneak into capsules. For example, we've seen an instance of this difficulty in the unary
operation of negation. In order to reduce the number of cases that need to be handled, we first
change the two operands (if necessary) to rid them of |independent| components. The original 
operands are put into capsules called |old_p| and |old_exp|, which will be recycled after the 
binary operation has been safely carried out.

The first argument to |add_or_subtract| is the location of a value node in a capsule or pair node
that will soon be recycled. The second argument is either a location within a pair or transform node
of |cur_exp|, or it is NULL (which means that |cur_exp| itself should be the second argument). The
third argument is either |plus| or |minus|.

The sum or difference of the numeric quantities will replace the second operand. Arithmetic overflow
may go undetected; users aren't supposed to be monkeying around with really big values. Here's the
current situation: The dependency list |v| of type |t| should either be put into the current
expression (if |q=NULL|) or into location |q| within a pair node (otherwise). The destination
(|cur_exp| or |q|) formerly held a dependency list with the same final pointer as the list |v|.

Here is a routine that is similar to |times|; but it is invoked only internally, when |v| is a
|fraction| whose magnitude is at most~1, and when |cur_type >= mp_color_type|.

The |hard_times| routine multiplies a nice color or pair by a dependency list. TODO

Let |c| be one of the eight transform operators. The procedure call |set_up_trans(c)| first changes
|cur_exp| to a transform that corresponds to |c| and the original value of |cur_exp|. (In particular,
|cur_exp| doesn't change at all if |c=transformed_by|.)

Then, if all components of the resulting transform are |known|, they are moved to the global
variables |txx|, |txy|, |tyx|, |tyy|, |tx|, |ty|; and |cur_exp| is changed to the known value zero.

Procedure |set_up_known_trans| is like |set_up_trans|, but it insists that the transformation be
entirely known.Here's a procedure that applies the transform |txx..ty| to a pair of coordinates in
locations |p| and~|q|.The simplest transformation procedure applies a transform to all coordinates of
a path. The |path_trans(c)(p)| macro applies a transformation defined by |cur_exp| and the transform
operator |c| to the path~|p|. The macro was used only once and has been inlined.Transforming a pen is
very similar, except that there are no |mp_left_type| and |mp_right_type| fields.Note that the shift
parameters |(tx,ty)| apply only to the path being stroked. The |dashscale| has to be adjusted to
scale the dash lengths in |mp_dash_ptr(q)| since the \ps\ output procedures will try to compensate
for the transformation we are applying to |mp_pen_ptr(q)|. Since this compensation is based on the
square root of the determinant, |sqdet| is the appropriate factor.The next transformation procedure
applies to edge structures. It will do any transformation, but the results may be substandard if the
picture contains text that uses downloaded bitmap fonts. The binary action procedure is
|do_edges_trans|, but we also need a function that just scales a picture. That routine is
|scale_edges|. Both it and the underlying routine |edges_trans| should be thought of as procedures
that update an edge structure |h|, except that they have to return a (possibly new) structure because
of the need to call |private_edges|.

The sum |txx + txy| is whichever of |txx| or |txy| is nonzero. The other sum is similar.Now we ready
for the main task of transforming the graphical objects in edge structure~|h|.The hard cases of
transformation occur when big nodes are involved, and when some of their components are unknown.

Let |p| point to a value field inside a big node of |cur_exp|, and let |q| point to a another value
field. The |bilin1| procedure replaces |p| by $p \cdot t + q \cdot u + \delta$.

Let |p| be a |mp_proto_dependent| value whose dependency list ends at |dep_final|. The following
procedure adds |v| times another numeric quantity to~|p|.The |bilin2| procedure is something like
|bilin1|, but with known and unknown quantities reversed. Parameter |p| points to a value field
within the big node for |cur_exp|; and |type(p)=mp_known|. Parameters |t| and~|u| point to value
fields elsewhere; so does parameter~|q|, unless it is |NULL| (which stands for zero). Location~|p|
will be replaced by $p \cdot t + v \cdot u + q $.Finally, in |bilin3| everything is |known|.

The chief executive of \MP\ is the |do_statement| routine, which contains the master switch that
causes all the various pieces of \MP\ to do their things, in the right order.

In a sense, this is the grand climax of the program: It applies all the tools that we have worked so
hard to construct. In another sense, this is the messiest part of the program: It necessarily refers
to other pieces of code all over the place, so that a person can't fully understand what is going on
without paging back and forth to be reminded of conventions that are defined elsewhere. We are now at
the hub of the web.

The structure of |do_statement| itself is quite simple. The first token of the statement is fetched
using |get_x_next|. If it can be the first token of an expression, we look for an equation, an
assignment, or a title. Otherwise we use a |case| construction to branch at high speed to the
appropriate routine for various and sundry other types of commands, each of which has an \quote
{action procedure} that does the necessary work.

The program uses the fact that |min_primary_command = max_statement_command=type_name| to interpret
a statement that starts with, e.g., |string|, as a type declaration rather than a boolean expression.

/*tex

For |mp_execute|, we need to define a structure to store the redirected input and output. This
structure holds the five relevant streams: the three informational output streams, the PostScript
generation stream, and the input stream. These streams have many things in common, so it makes sense
to give them their own structure definition.

\startitemize
\startitem |fptr| is a virtual file pointer \stopitem
\startitem |data| is the data this stream holds \stopitem
\startitem |cur|  is a cursor pointing into |data| \stopitem
\startitem |size| is the allocated length of the data stream \stopitem
\startitem |used| is the actual length of the data stream \stopitem
\stopitemize

There are small differences between input and output: |term_in| never uses |used|, whereas the other
four never use |cur|.

We need a function to clear an output stream, this is called at the beginning of |mp_execute|. We
also need one for destroying an output stream, this is called just before a stream is (re)opened.

The global instance contains a pointer instead of the actual structure even though it is essentially
static, because that makes it is easier to move the object around.Another type is needed: the
indirection will overload some of the file pointer objects in the instance (but not all). For
clarity, an indirect object is used that wraps a |FILE *|.Here are all of the functions that need to
be overloaded for |mp_execute|.This is where we fill them all in.This might change too.

Some extensions

Get a numeric value from \MP\ is not easy. We have to consider the macro and the loops, as also the
internal type (this is a first attempt, and more work is needed). If we are inside a |for| loop, then
the global |loop_ptr| is not null and the other loops eventually nested are available by mean of
|loop_ptr->link|. The current numeric value is stored in |old_value|.

This is a lightweight version, one that also omits the quotes around strings. When we scan we check
the type anyway. We don't really have a list either. So we only serialize symbolic names, strings and
single tokens.

/*tex 

The path constructor is somewhat complicated. We start with a pair or path and in the later case we
have to go to the end. Then we check for curly braced curl or direction settings (separated by |..| 
when we have two), tension specifiers, or controls. When we finally pick up a point (after the 
mandate |..|) we check for a cycle command and we abuse that command code to also provide a point
relative to the previous, with absolute x or y, or a combination which depends on the following 
numeric or pair.

Finally we wrap up, and \METAPOST\ calculates the relation between the previous and current point 
and then moves on to the next point specification. Because all this magick is packed into one 
constructor there are some |goto|'s involved and also some |command| and |operation| tracking and 
because an expression looks ahead (after all it has to know when it ends) we know what is coming 
after it. The next function not only looks complicated, but also is.

Here we do whatever is needed to complete \MP's job gracefully on the local operating system. The
code here might come into play after a fatal error; it must therefore consist entirely of \quote
{safe} operations that cannot produce error messages. For example, it would be a mistake to call
|str_room| or |make_string| at this time, because a call on |overflow| might lead to an infinite
loop.

Watch out: we also close all files when we do a subrun (execute) so that's why we have this static
closer.
