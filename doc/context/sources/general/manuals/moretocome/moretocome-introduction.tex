\startchapter[title={Introduction}]

After wrap-up series eight got too many pages due to lengthy articles it was time
to start a new series. We might add to the \quote {beyond} series but because as
a side effect of playing with bytemaps a nice cover evolved from experiments so
here we are. The previous series focused on extending the engine in fundamental
ways, like the builders. So, if we add something fundamental it will go in that
series.

Here we're back at applications and experiments. Although the title of this
series points to the future, we're talking the present. One thing we learned from
the past is that there is always a new challenge ahead. So, with the \LUATEX\
aging (some 20 years now) and \LUAMETATEX\ having taken its place in \CONTEXT,
you can still expect the usual mix of \TEX, \METAPOST\ and \LUA.
