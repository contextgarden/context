\startchapter[title={Introduction}]

This is the eights wrapup of the \LUATEX\ and \LUAMETATEX\ development cycle. The
last one was \quote {ontarget} and focused on what we did when the engine got
mature. This time we zoom in on developments that go a bit beyond what we
originally planned. One can argue that for instance some of the math extensions
should have ended up here but for us a turning point was when additional par
passes became stable, which was around the time of the 2024 \CONTEXT\ meeting.
We'll see what comes after that.

Most of the chapters in this document were first published in \TUGBOAT, in which
case we have a (year or so) delay in including it here; just become a \TUG\
member if you want it sooner. We therefore want to explicitly mention that Karl
Berry did an amazing job on copy-editing and getting it production ready in a way
that we can still feed back fixes to the text. He and Barbara Beeton not only
improve the English but also catch glitches in our explanations. It just gets
better, so, thanks to the editorial team!
