%D This file is loaded at runtime, thereby providing an excellent place for hacks,
%D patches, extensions and new features. There can be local overloads in cont-loc
%D (which has always been the case) and experimental code in cont-exp (which is also
%D so old that I need to remind myself to check it occasionally, so here is the
%D reminder).
