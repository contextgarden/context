-- This one is an outlier because the callback has several different calls all over
-- the line break routine. It started out as a tracing feature but can also be used
-- for adding functionality. For performance reasons we assume single usage but that
-- might change. The steps kept the identifiers from tracing: initialize, start,
-- list, stop, collect, line, delete, report, wrapup. The checks parameter is the
-- value of the 'checklinebreaks' integer variable.
--
-- In addition to the overload and tracers usage we now also handle twins with this
-- mechanism but that might change (for instance we could move that to the engine
-- but keep a traced version here.
